THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

Oh, right. So I did tell you about that one time with the Ant and the Grasshopper, yes?

"I cannot talk now. I have to work."

"Aw, c'mon. A quick little spin wouldn't hurt, would it? Dance with me!"

"You fool. Winter is coming."

"Don't be so blind. It's Summer now, and the sun is shining."

and then, later...

"I have nothing for you - go away. What I have saved is only enough for myself and my family."

"I understand. But it's so cold, and I don't have much longer to live. Come out and dance with me! At least until the sun goes down, and then you can go back in to your well-earned warmth and plenty."

"You idiot. The snow is already falling, and I will not come out."

"Of course it's falling. It's Winter now, and the snow is beautiful."
