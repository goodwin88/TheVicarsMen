HAIR

There was an aging married man, long wed to his devoted, sensible wife. He had a young mistress on the side, who was spry and frisky.

He saw in the mirror that he was starting to grey noticably and he rather liked it. He thought it made him look distinguished, and so on.

However, his mistress felt that she was too young to be with a man that looked so old, and so she would pluck out his grey hairs when then were together.

His wife could tell something was strange about him, but couldn't quite put her finger on it.

However, she did feel that he looked too young to compliment her; she didn't want to be mistaken for his mother! And so she would pluck out his darker hairs when they were together.

He was soon quite bald, much to everyone's dismay.
