## The saltshell   Copy (8)

NOTASULGA, ALABAMA



The Vicar's Man-o-War held the door for me, and I entered the diner. I then immediately waited to one side for him to lead us both to a booth by the window. It was breakfast time; the place was crowded, and there was only the one place to sit. Next to us was a young man eating alone; I slid into the booth facing away from him on reflex. The Vicar's Man-o-War is jealous and petty. I do what I can to avoid provocation.


He almost sat next to me, blocking me in. But then, even as he crouched onto the seat, he switched deftly to the other side. I saw from his glance that he wanted to face the door. I looked out the window when the waitress arrived. He ordered for me, as usual, and I avoided eye contact with the woman.

Even so, I could tell that she recognized our situation. The shift of her hips in the corner of my eye. The way she spoke to me when addressing both of us. She kept asking me directly things like: white or wheat, black or with cream and sugar. Each time it was he who answered and I just nodded, reading the license plates on the trucks outside.

 

I kept my hands on the table, in plain sight where he liked to see them.


When the food arrived, he salted and peppered it and then told me to eat. I ate; this would be our last stop before making the interstate. There would be no stopping then, no turning back.

He devoured his food like something feral, with a ravenous mania. And yet he still managed to talk, giddily and talking with his hands, gesturing with the fork and the knife. I don't know what it was he said. I just nodded and thought about further down the road.

 

The waitress returned to ask if everything was alright. She was just doing her job, checking in on the customer and so forth. Well, more specifically she asked:

 

"Can I get you folks anything else?"

 

He shook his head and waved her away. Undeterred, but yet still within the bounds of propriety, she asked me more pointedly:

 

"Is everything alright here?"

 

I could feel her looking me over for bruises, a black eye, needle tracks, anything - but that's not how he works. His fingers are soft flabby things, and his knuckles are tender. I was afraid to look at her; I knew I would somehow betray everything in that moment, if so.

 

"We're fine," he said, annoyed and final about it.

 

"Well, I'll just top up your cups then, and here's your check-"

 

She slopped the coffee into his mug and then my own, splattering it messily onto my lap.

 

"Oh my god, I'm so sorry."

 

The next few seconds could have been choreographed and staged before royalty. I was hurt; the seeping liquid scalded through to my thighs and spread nastily - but truly, all I was aware of was the sudden spike of his anger. The surging rage made the hair lift on my neck. He threw down his silverware and made as though to get up. But we were in a fixed window booth; the waitress blocked his way, sputtering and apologetic.

 

She wiped a cloth napkin about the spill, clattering saucers and plates. People looked over to watch us.

 

"Oh honey, I'm sorry. You can go clean up in the back."

 

I shook my head. I formed words like "No" and "I'm okay" within my mouth, but she put her hand on my wrist with an iron grip that squeezed until it hurt. Like a kitten limp in the jaws of its mother, or the drowning hauled from the sea, I went along with the pulling motion and stumbled to my feet.

 

"Ladies room is back near the kitchen, left at the sign. You can't miss it."

 

I did as I was told, as I was directed, hurrying past the other patrons. We were making a scene now, he would be crazy with anger later, and I was afraid. I didn't dare look back, but I could hear them behind me with words that said one thing in shouts that said another. Another man's voiced joined them, maybe the cook, or the manager; he placated.

 

At the rear of the diner was a little alcove and a quick bend that led to the kitchen, past the restrooms. The sign she had mentioned wasn't near this, but I saw it off to the side. It was an EXIT sign. It was a side door out. Two steps, a push through the glass, and I could be free.

 

I heard him bellowing as he approached. There was no more stalling now. Soon he would be on me, dragging me; perhaps by my hair to make a point.

 

"The fuck you looking at," he bullied freely to someone. He was reckless and livid.

 

"Let's go," he announced, loud enough to shout it, "I'm coming back there." In two or three heartbeats, this moment would pass eternally. I could hear his boots.

 

 

 

All his bullets have eyes upon them. The dragon he rides is swift and tireless. The Vicar's Man-o-War is the last of his kind, charged with a divine geis. He is the blade that cuts; the Shadow of God on Earth. I have held him as he cried, so many times spent from rage, shuddering and pathetic. He would kill me before he let me go.

## The saltshell

THE SALTSHELL

"...While there is little factual evidence to support the existance of the Saltshell as a genuine relic, the numerous references to it in surviving myth are enough to make speculation about its necessary properties more than an exercise in idle musings. For if such an object were to have ever existed, the ramifications to the field of biology alone would shake that noble field of study to its very core, not to mention a complete revision of meteorology and theology.

However mundane or miraculous, we can begin to sort through the varied accounts and build a composite description from the historical record. To begin with, we can surmise that the Saltshell as described was never intended as a human tool. We know this because all known sources pointedly remark on the punishing discomfort imposed upon those who have used it. The manner of its use requires that wearer insert both hands into the device and contort the fingers in a most unnatural fashion. The object then either seals or clamps around the wrists such that the tips of the fingers within are decidedly ruined. Exactly how is still a matter of speculation. In the more familiar epic, this takes the form of small thorns that catch the hands in a pinch. However, there are known variations to the tale that refer to fishhooks or "shark teeth". These variants originate along the more coastal areas, possibly reflecting the important fishing traditions there.

One theory is that the device was intended to fit smaller, more slender digits, or perhaps those bearing extended talons such that the catching of the fingertips becomes more a matter of close-fitting contact for the purposes of efficient tactile feedback than a means of torturous operation on fleshier human hands. This of course presumes a manufactured origin.

The next point of consideration is the nature of the shell itself. The descriptions vary but tend to fall into two distinct groups with isolated exceptions. The major description, particularly along the seacoast and those deeper inland along rivers leading to port, is that the shell is in fact the remains of a sea creature much like the common nautilus. The lesser description, more prevalent in the isolated mountain provinces and in other wooded areas where logging replaces fishing as the main industry, is that the shell is all that remains of a large extinct form of snail. The primitive nomadic peoples of the Southern Wastes are unique in that they refer to the Saltshell as a magical ram's horn (the "Bitter Horn"), yet in function and all other characteristics this local relic resembles the Saltshell and so does not merit further distinction.

The tendancy to relate the shell to a more locally familiar analogous object is interesting, and perhaps the truth of the matter is that the shell/horn is an intermediate mix of all known descriptions.

All accounts mention a widening spiral that leads to the twin openings for the hands. And the defining similarity is that the shell itself is made of a cloudy, dense, crystalline salt which does not melt. It is unclear exactly how the shell functions, for there is no meaningful agreement among the various sources. Some stories describe the shell simply as a means to shackle the violently insane, specifically those possessed by occult forces. Other tales refer to it as a "water shaping" tool useful for anything from catching fish to battling whales to smoothing away tidal waves. It is apparently also useful for dowsing and rainmaking. In one instance, the wearer was able to determine the truthfulness of those who spoke in her presence.

All this is severely taxing upon the user who is quite trapped within the shell anywhere from a few hours to several days. During this time, the blood from the user fills the spiral cavity inside. At some point the shell releases its connection and the user is able to withdraw his hands. It may be that the blood itself triggers this. If the device is purely an inert object, perhaps the accumulation of blood disrupts some inner mechanism. The wounds sustained by wearing the Saltshell are unanimously described as maiming and disfiguring; more than a few of the myths make poetic use of this by having the wearers be artisans of some sort, or dancers, and thereafter unable to follow their trade. By contrast, the scars themselves are apparently quite beautiful and are seen by many as an honorific consolation for the mangled hands. In some cultures during times of festival, parents will mimic this scarring pattern on the hands of their children using stains and other pigments to temporarily mark the skin. These designs vary, but are always elaborately detailed..."
## The girl and the tower

THE GIRL AND THE TOWER 

Sometimes, when passing through the lowest level of the tower, she would stop there in the middle of the floor and look up into the great hollow shaft to where the Witch was known to reside in a chamber at the top. Round and around her eyes would follow the rising spiral stair. Sometimes smothered in gloom, it clung as ivy to the curving stone wall. Sometimes it was illuminated by shafts of light from tall slits in the masonry.

These slim windows were regular and narrow, intended for defensive archery - yes, all that she knew well; quite clever, and so on. And yet the charm of these slivers of light and breath was not simply from this heroic application, but because through them, at regular, radial intervals, you could see higher and loftier views of the castle grounds.

Then, nearing the trapdoor in the furthest reaches you might even begin to see beyond the castle walls, perhaps even as far as the Lake Beyond the Briars. Might and perhaps. Since she had never dared the stairs that high to see for herself. They were old, wooden and wormy. It was not that she was afraid of heights, nor concerned about the lack of a railing; she was a reckless child. In fact, she would have gathered her skirts and hopped up the walls like a monkey, side to side, if the tower were only narrow enough.

No, she was not afraid. If anything the decrepit and dizzyingly, inherently hazardous nature of the tower, with its elegant swirl of rotting timber and teasing glimpses of what the hawks must see, was keenly attractive on the whole... except for the chamber at its peak where the Witch was known to reside.

From her vantage far below, she could only dimly find the floorboards to the room capping the tower. Occasionally at night, curious and violent scuffles sounded down to her. She would then feel as though she were down a covered well, looking up through the tarry void at the gleamings of light through the floor that made her ceiling. With held breath, she marked the time between such muted crashes and the soft touch of dusty silt upon her nose; dust that drifted down to her upturned face as powdered sugar on gaudy cakes.

That was night, when the Witch was active. Now, during the day, sunlight pierced the tower through the thin windows and made straight golden blades of shifting liquid light in the air. She had seen a trick once (and just a trick; it was not magic - not real Magic, she knew even then) that involved a box with narrow openings all over, like the tower. The trickster hid inside it. He invited those watching to jab scimitars into this box while he groaned and chortled and carried on in a most amusing manner. In the end, the box bristled with blades, and it looked plainly as though he must have been run through by at least a dozen wicked points, and yet he expressed none of the agony one would expect. Her sister, older and wiser, spoiled this delightful display by leaning over and saying, "He's quite flexible, I've seen him through the keyhole with the maids. He is dodging these blades in ways you can't imagine, but that's all there is to it."

She looked up now, with the setting sun skewering the tower, and she pictured a giant crowded inside with her. His head would go into the Witch's chamber. His body would flatten and curl like a serpent to avoid the cutting light.

The two times that she dared climb the spiral she was frightened off by the Witch. Once, at night, she felt surely she could approach under the cover of the Witch's usual ruckus. And yet, just as she was starting to see the peaks of the castle wall outside, the noise above stopped entirely. And it was a keenly predatory, listening silence; the severity of it, the sudden abruptness, startled the girl into fleeing down and around and out of the tower, without a backward glance. In such a silence, her own pounding heart and ragged breathed resounded as though she were screaming her fear to the heavens.

And then once, during the day, when the high chamber was quiet (as usual, for the Witch was sleeping), she crept up to that same spot on the stairs and dared a step further. The cautious daylight calm then broke with such sudden thrashing about from above that the whole tower itself shook and threatened to topple down about her ankles. Needless to say, she turned tail and lit out for safety.

So after those two attempts, she contented herself with her ground floor view and the lower windows on the stairs. As for the Witc
## The stagecoach fragment part 1

THE STAGECOACH FRAGMNET - PART 1 

The black stagecoach threatened to fly apart as they hurtled through one grand arch after another along the approach to Dis. It creaked and complained, pulled by a pair of black, lathered horses that glistened and churned madly before the whip.

"Faster! Faster, you wretches!" The driver wound the reins further about his bare raw hand, heedless of the digging leather strap. He cracked the lash and the coach lurched and rattled and rumbled. He did not need to look behind him to know that the Roc was still there and gaining ground. It caught up with them just as they entered into the grand arch and it had to veer away to avoid collision. The bird passed above him, an impossibly huge vulture, blotting out the sun and raining flecks of old carrion and coarse synthetic plumage. It rose sharply to the air and cried a ringing shriek of frustration. The next archway lay within sight, as well as the others beyond that spanned the rotting clay road at regular intervals. It was just a matter of threading the needle.

The horses were tired, and likely should they fall, the Roc would devour them first, buying those aboard the coach a few minutes headstart on foot. Hopefully it would not come to that; they were only a few arches away from the towering main gates. Once within range of the city's cannons, the great bird would have to give up the hunt or be shot from the sky.

Along the horizon, the grey city Dis lay scattered like a scrap pile. Its twisted skyline bristled with helical spires and dull leaden minarets. And all was framed by a more distant, sickly radiance. Living so close to the glow, lead was the material of choice - one of fashion, if not necessity.

"Our driver makes good time," said the young man within, watching from the cabin window. His travelling companion sat across from him, nestled in thick robes and beneath a sprawling beard. The older man looked up from the tome he was fingering through and knuckled his glasses up his nose. He glanced at the rushing terrain and the ominous shade that circled and stalked them, in and out of sight, along the desert floor.

"All time is good time," he replied and sniffed, resuming his readings.

"Why are we going to Dis, sir?"

"I did say that once we reached the arches I would tell you," He nodded and closed the book, keeping a finger tucked inside. With his other hand he stroked his beard, a routine gesture of contemplation. The young man's face was soft and smooth. All around them the carriage jingled and groaned, the horses thundered, the driver cursed and the Roc whistled and wheeled above, crying its bloodlust.

"We are not. We are going to the wastes beyond it." The young man turned in his seat and look ahead, seeing the eeriely radiant skyline. The glow was strange and it frightened him.

"But sir, there is nothing in the wastelands."

"Precisely, my young friend. And in that void are things you are now ready to understand."

The youth was silent after that, but he hovered near to the window and watched the chase and the dodge. Ever larger loomed Dis and peering now, he could make out curls of chimney smoke and dots of light from the windows of high towers. Long red pennants snapped and bucked from the top of each peak like a mass of angry serpents above the city. And each bore the old sign of the Vicar.

The din outside was so constant and prolonged that, despite the dire situation, it faded into the background as a muted spectacle. Within the carriage, there was nothing the two passengers could do, anyway. The young man even felt himself to be a little sleepy. The driver had pulled his pistol and would occasionally fire blindly up at the sky behind them while clinging to the taut reins in his other hand. This bound hand ran red with blood now, down the leather straps and onto his own dark cloaks.

The pistolshot was quite ineffectual, but the noise goaded the fatigued horses and it perhaps made the driver feel less like a hapless morsel. There was only one archway left and beyond it a long empty stretch until the main gates. If they were to arrive safely, their hopes rested upon the shoulders of the city guard, now. Presumably unwilling to let wayward travellers lead the Roc to their walls, they were sure to begin firing any moment now. The last gate was narrower than the rest, and on either side lay the crumpled the wrecks of careless drivers gone before. Horses, driven so harshly, blind and insane with terror, would simply plow into the stone columns if the hand at the reins was careless or unsteady. The driver split his attention between the Roc, which had now circled around again for another diving pass and controlling his steeds. His guiding hand was cramping and felt as though on fire, knotted into the leather, it would be useless after this for several days. But he had made this journey before. As a driver on the open road, he was not easily rattled - and he was being well paid for his troubles.

He had been counting his bullets, firing the last just as he entered the split second sactuary of the narrow last arch. He cast down the weapon and took up the hand flare, ripping it into fire with his teeth on the pullcord. He shoved the sputtering geyser of light into a holder and struck the lash over the wet, flayed backs before him. They would fetch a price at any of the city factories when this was all over. And when coupled with his remaining fee, it would be enough to purchase another pair for the return. Now if only the cannons would sound.

The Roc, seeing its prey in the open, drew up high into the sky, preparing for a final, killing pass. It flapped its terrible wings, shedding old tattered plastic feathers and trailing loose cabling. It hung in the sky for a beat, the grace of the motion as beautiful as a stalled airship, then it tilted down to begin its plummet, drawing itself inwards to go faster. It fell out of the sky as a heavy black drop of petroleum. Unable to keep from screaming, it opened its beak for a last, maddening, screeching howl.

The first volley was not quite on target, but it did graze the great bird, enough to startle it from its dive. Its keen lethal grace flustered into a sudden squawking mess of flapping and backpedalling. However momentum carried it forward and it still brushed over the fleeing coach, close enough for the driver to smell it. Old flesh and exhaust fumes roaring by. The horses lurched to the side in a panic, taking them all off-road. Inside, the cabin tossed about.

"Gah! Did you hear that, sir? The cannons! They see us!"

Tangled in his robes, the older man struggled upright. His book had slipped from his fingers and closed itself, losing his place. He scowled at this.

"I've lost my place."

"What? Sir, are you alright? There - again!" And indeed, the cannons could be heard booming in the distance, followed by a low crunching thud close by. The driver cackled loudly in his way, regaining control over the horses and making their way back onto the hardpacked road. They were safe.

The Roc flew in crazy turns, outraged and confused as each shot found its mark. Bits of broken machinery rained down each time until it finally turned and withdrew back into the desert, dripping gouts of dark fluid from its matted plumage.

It was not long before they were within the shadow of the city. Formed by the intensity of the glow beyond, the shadow of Dis reached outward from the walls and sheltered a surrounding tent village. Here lived those too poor to dwell with the protective lead walls and palaces. And here suffered those exposed, even in shadow, to the glow beyond.
## The stagecoach fragment part 2

THE STAGECOACH FRAGMNET - PART 2 

Locals came out to witness their arrival before the gates. Locals that lived outside Dis, outside the thick, lead walls; poor and suffering the ravages of mutation and poison. Children with faces like cauliflower, tumors upon tumors. The young man grimaced and his master drew down the shades from within the coach.

"Enough of that. We'll be inside shortly and you'll see a different kind of splendor, I assure you." He recovered his book from the floor of the coach and began again at the beginning, reading each page as though it were newly scribed. He pulled his hand through his beard slowly.

"Master, why not flip through to where you left off?" The elder said nothing but turned the book around. He held his current place, but flipping back to the first page. There on the paper, beneath the title, was a small engraved portrait of a blandly smiling boy.

"This book, my young friend, tells the story of a life living." He pulled the book back into his lap, "This one is of little consequence so far, and already I am up to the babe's second year. He is in a field picking flowers in this scene."

"How marvelously charming!" The younger exclaimed, smiling.

"Indeed, quite droll. But I rather prefer a beginning with more spark to it." He snapped the book shut with an air of finality, then handed it to the young man across the carriage. The youth took it, not understanding. He felt over the leather cover and found it warm to the touch.

"Always," said his master, "Always open it from the beginning. See now for yourself."

The elder's eyes twinkled in the jostling gloom. Outside sounded the gruff speech of guards and the creaking wheels paused. They had arrived at the gates to Dis.

The youth opened the book to the first page. The title was now different, and the portrait now of a mere infant - perhaps a girl, perhaps not, too young to tell. He looked up, confused.

"Yes, my boy, a new story begins... a new life," he waved his hand absently, "Perhaps it will be one with a little more flair than daisies in pastures."

The younger began to read. The child in the book was a girl, born on a battlefield, cut crying from her mother's slack womb. Her mother had been killed, and the armies had moved on. Her midwife was a cowardly soldier who hid under the slain to play dead himself. He was searching her mother's body for money, anything.

She was still alive when he started, but mortally wounded. He searched her tatters in silence, ignoring her feeble moans and her flesh draining paler and paler. She was royalty, attacked with the rest of her family and left for dead. In mere moments she would join her kin in endless peace. The looter rolled her over and snatched off her jewelry. He pried her fingers from around a slim ornamental blade. The knife was frail and beautiful, meant for cutting fruits and opening letters. It would hardly stand up in battle, but might fetch a coin or two. Suddenly, the woman lolled her head, gasping out wetly from a half-slit throat. With a surge of strength, she pulled the coward down to her and spat red into his panicked recoiling face.

"My child," she gurgled with utter conviction, struggling with him, "will live."

She held his gaze and her grip, streaming down from her wound to her ruddy soaked robes. The coward watched her die with the look of command upon her face and her rustling voice in his ears. He placed his hand to her belly and felt the child inside. With a shaking hand, he began to cut-

"I see this life is already off to an interesting start, mmm?" The elder chuckled, showing a thin smile. The stagecoach moved forward again. The groaning of great doors on greater hinges surrounded them, deep and resonant as whalesong.

The youth swallowed thickly, "Is this real? Is it happening, somewhere?"

"Oh yes, my boy. Or perhaps it has already happened, or still yet will. But it is quite real."

"And if should I close this book?"

"The life would end, as all must."

"But that means that boy you were just reading about, in the field with the flowers?"

"Gone without a trace, I'm afraid. In fact when I lost my place earlier, I was reading about a young man much your age, just beginning his prime," He snapped his fingers abruptly, and then grinned. "He was an adventurer! I wonder what will become of his siblings was planning to save. He was about to fight the forces of evil or something like that. I have to confess that I was skimming."

"Evil?"

"Mmm, An evil that now will go unchecked. But I see that you are disturbed. Don't be. These stories are always set long ago, far away. Other worlds. That sort of thing."

"But these are lives! Real people!"

"Then I suggest you keep your thumb on that page until you find a suitable bookmark. And begin where you left off - otherwise," he flared his eyes dramatically, "Madness."

The awful responsibility of it settled onto him, overwhelmingly. He tried to hand it back.

"No, you must hold it now, my apprentice. You may give it back to me when the story is finished. Or when you've had enough." He peeked through the shade into the city and smiled, getting his cane.

"Ah! And I see we have come."

= = =

They arrived into a bustling plaza surrounded by towering buildings of bleak slabs of pocked lead and dark stone. At one end of the expanse rose a sprawling mound of basalt rubble as though the earth had vomited up the slag in a messy heap over the buildings, which then cooled in place. Winding stairs were hewn into this black stone leading to an immense, crudely tapered cathedral marked with red banners.

"That is the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, built on the site of the Great Eruption centuries ago. We are expected inside." The elder stepped down from the coach with difficulty, assisted by the driver. He directed the removal of their luggage to servants of the church who were already in waiting. Among them was a rich brown woman of visible status and stature who stepped forward to greet the travellers. She was dressed in heavy robes and she bore the Vicar's mark upon her neck. The young man saw that her smile matched his master's.

"Ah, bonjour. Welcome." They clasped hands and kissed briefly. She spoke in a crisp manner, "Lailoken. Always a pleasure to see you here in this forsaken city."

"Kiskil-lilla. Considering our passage here was as perilous as usual, I can say that it is a pleasure to be seen in Dis as well." They chuckled cordially, then she turned to the youth.

"And ici? who is your second?"

"This is Ishmael, he is my pupil of a sorts. We are travellers together, these days. Ishmael this is Her Holiness Kiskil-lilla, the presiding authority in Dis" He set his hand upon Ishmael's shoulder. She extended hers to him demurely. The youth fumbled the book in his grasp to his other hand, keeping his place within it and awkwardly took her fingers. She wore two rings, one set with a dark red gem and another band enscribed with the old language. Unsure of propriety, the youth kissed both rings to be safe. As he did so she nodded to the older man.

"How charming, his hair. It is wild like yours. I might have mistaken him for you, years ago." Ishmael looked down politely, confused. She spoke to the three servants in waiting without turning to address them.

"Senoy. Sansenoy. Take their things in. Semangelof, alert the staff that guests of prominence have arrived. Lailoken, will you be staying long?"

"No, my dear. Three days at most. We are bound for beyond the city. Into the wastes."

She tsked and pursed her lips, "Such a shame. You will miss the climax of the fights this Sunday." She looked to Ishmael, "The bullfights. We are selecting our new champion. But you may still see tonight's round and perhaps a few others before you go."

"It will be an education," said the elder, about to elaborate when a cry sounded from the plaza. Thick with the midday market, it was hard to tell what the commotion was about, but a rush of guards soon streamed into the crowd, pulling apart two commoners squabbling in the dust.

"As will this be, I suspect," whispered Lailoken, barely rustling his beard.

Their host moved a step closer to them, "Perhaps we should enter the basilica, my friends. You are surely tired from your travels." The crowd roared again, flaring at some new outrage.

"I think you are right, my dear. I am weary. However, Ishmael, why don't you investigate this further and report over dinner? I am curious what you might learn. We shall be inside should you need us." So saying, the two proceeded up the long winding stairs, talking to each other as old friends. His master and his cane. The lady and her rings.

Ishamael held the book still, tucked under his arm, his finger still in place. He thought of the child within, and wondered at her fate. She was an heir, a princess or a queen. A precious early babe, in the arms of a scoundrel. In the book in his arms, doubly precious. Holding it close to his chest he approached the swirling mob of the market.

Stalls and stands had been set up through the plaza, with merchants selling and smiths tinkering and cobblers nailing and scraping. However, all had paused in their labors and haggling to oggle the ring of soldiers clearing back a space in their midst.

Ishmael sprang up onto the wheel of a parked wagon to get a better view. He saw one figure circling another crawling on the ground. The man standing was gesturing vigorously, pacing the clearing as the guards struggled to hold back the mob.

"See! See 'ow it crowls, dis abom'nashin, on legz loik rubba! Dis twistid mockry a' flesh n' bown!" The accusing figure ran up and kicked the other hard in the chest, eliciting what might have been pity or a shared outrage from the crowd.

Others were already perched on the wagon, watching. Ishmael leaned to one and asked, "What's this going on?"

"Aya! That feller there's Ignatius th' Prophet. The Mad Prophet, some might say. It looks like he's got his eye on poor Coconino today. Brained him good already!"

"On who?" Ishmael said, craning his neck to see clearly. The local turned and gave him a look, seeing his strange mode of dress.

"You must be new. That's Coconino. Been in these streets since forever. Not exactly mad, but just, you know, touched in the head. Can't barely speak, Coconino, but wouldn't hurt a fly. He's normally what you'd call harmless, but I guess he must've upset Ignatius somehow."

"Well aren't they going to stop him?"

"Who? They who? The guards?" The local cackled abruptly. "I doubt it. Ignatius is fuckin' walking miracle, my friend. Pillar of salt. Pillar of fire. He's got followers all over this town. Hey! Oy! Where you goin'?"

Ishamael had already hopped down and was pushing his way closer. Coming nearer he saw that the one pointed out as Ignatius was tall and lanky, swaddled in dirty robes and wearing what looked like a cheap plastic mask of a mouse or rat. His fingers were long and knobby, curled around a cobblestone. He raised it into the air and the crowd hollered around him.

"I am God's will! I be God's 'and... I am de shadow of God on dis eart' an' I will not suffer dis broken monsta t' live and breet." He brought the brick down with a crunching thud against the back of Coconino's head. His victim flopped onto the ground, pawing at the uneven stones, his arms curiously loose. Ishmael could see that they weren't broken, but they weren't right somehow either. They weren't straight. They bowed and flexed sickeningly under the creature's weight. Ishmael found himself thinking 'creature' because the more he looked at Coconino the less human it appeared.

It had something like a tail. It had odd boxy square ears. It had a vacant smile plastered on its stylized animal face with features mangled and battered and bleeding. It had odd protruberances along its surface. It had a surface instead of skin, like rubber or oiled leather. It would have seemed blatantly mechanical if not for the way it moved and grimaced. Smiling without smiling. Swaying and staggering about to its feet. It moaned a pathetic laughing noise and lurched away from Ignatius, only to stumble onto the ground again, sobbing and babbling.

Ignatius pried another stone from the ground, pulling it almost effortlessly and over his head with both hands. "Chu alla bear witness! Chu gon see de troot, I will make y'see de troot!" He swung it down into the face of Coconino. Of all things, sparks and embers squirted out among the ankles and sandals and Coconino flopped about in spasms, the stone still crushed to its face. Startled, Ignatius stepped back and raised a hand against the discharge.

"Leave it alone!" Ishmael pushed through the distracted guards who turned at the zapping shriek of ruined electronics. He clutched his book tightly and looked around to the dirty curious faces looking back at him. Jackals all, none would help him. The masked figure regained his composure and watched him silently, curling his fingers into fists, but his expression otherwise unreadable.

"Chu, boy. Ar' ya defendin' dis monsta?"

"I say it is a machine. You know they are innocent." Ishmael kicked aside the stone, revealing Coconino's caved in face, still grinning, the eyes black with running fluid. He knelt by the still trembling, strangely soft body and hesitated a moment before touching it, brushing his fingers over the carapace. It yielded under his touch, warm and springy, but nothing like skin. The local had said that it had been wandering the streets of Dis forever and it certainly looked like it, cracked and scuffed all over.

As he examined the surface he found what he was looking for, a flap covering jacks and plugs, serial information, recessed buttons, other marks in the old language. The buttons were caked with grime, inoperable, and he had to dig out a wad of filth to get at the vital socket. Those who could see what he was doing gasped and murmured to each other, rippling the whisper back through the crowd that Coconino was truly a machine all along, all along, all along.

Some that were elderly and remembered, nodding, eyes watering. Those that were younger disbelieved. The robotic age had come and gone. Everybody knew that.

Ishmael carefully swapped the book to his other hand and dug around in his pocket for the tool given to him by his master, learned and wise. He inserted it into the socket and it lit up a red light that flashed for mere seconds before turning green. Coconino abruptly quivered into stillness like a dropped penny.

Ishmael pocketed the device and stood up from the wreckage. Ignatius stalked towards him, rolling his shoulders, seething. He stood over the youth and looked down into his eyes. This closely, Ishmael could see more into the mask and the hard gaze there was most unmistakably, profoundly insane.

"Dis ting was a creatcha a' Set, Seth, Setekh, Sut, idol god of storms, slayer of Apep, equal to and rival of Horus and a pagan abom'nashin before de one troo God a' Isaac, Abraham, an' Ishmael."

"I a-am Ishmael." The madman's eyes narrowed, and he growled, bristling visibly. Ishmael gulped down the lump in his throat, continuing lamely, "I'm a g-guest of Her H-holiness Kiskil-lilla... the presiding... authority... in... Dis. The city, I mean."

"Chu ar' ded." He knocked past the youth and waded into the crowd, taking his oppressive menace with him. Already the guards were shuffling people along, trying to disperse things back to normal. Ishmael felt a tug at his waist and he turned, ready to fight, feeling threatening, unwelcome eyes on him from all angles.

"Hey! Easy there, pup." It was the local from before, with his hands up appeasingly. "I think you might want to keep moving, if you know what's good for you. You don't exactly blend in around here." Ishmael didn't take a good look before, but the fellow seemed amiable enough, younger than he was even and hungry, probably hoping to make quick cash off the tourist.

Ishmael turned towards the basilica and started to walk off, waving his hand dismissively, "I don't plan on staying here that long, thank you." The other licked his lips a moment, then shuffled after him.

"I can help you, y'know. Find whatever you need. If you plan on spending any more time outside the safety of the basilica I'd suggest you change into something more suitable for living in Dis."

"Like what?"

"Well," he said with a grin, "considering the friends you've already made, I'd say a coffin."
"I did say that once we reached the arches I would tell you," He nodded and closed the book, keeping a finger tucked inside. With his other hand he stroked his beard, a routine gesture of contemplation. The young man's face was soft and smooth. All around them the carriage jingled and groaned, the horses thundered, the driver cursed and the Roc whistled and wheeled above, crying its bloodlust.

"We are not. We are going to the wastes beyond it." The young man turned in his seat and look ahead, seeing the eeriely radiant skyline. The glow was strange and it frightened him.

"But sir, there is nothing in the wastelands."

"Precisely, my young friend. And in that void are things you are now ready to understand."

The youth was silent after that, but he hovered near to the window and watched the chase and the dodge. Ever larger loomed Dis and peering now, he could make out curls of chimney smoke and dots of light from the windows of high towers. Long red pennants snapped and bucked from the top of each peak like a mass of angry serpents above the city. And each bore the old sign of the Vicar.

The din outside was so constant and prolonged that, despite the dire situation, it faded into the background as a muted spectacle. Within the carriage, there was nothing the two passengers could do, anyway. The young man even felt himself to be a little sleepy. The driver had pulled his pistol and would occasionally fire blindly up at the sky behind them while clinging to the taut reins in his other hand. This bound hand ran red with blood now, down the leather straps and onto his own dark cloaks.

The pistolshot was quite ineffectual, but the noise goaded the fatigued horses and it perhaps made the driver feel less like a hapless morsel. There was only one archway left and beyond it a long empty stretch until the main gates. If they were to arrive safely, their hopes rested upon the shoulders of the city guard, now. Presumably unwilling to let wayward travellers lead the Roc to their walls, they were sure to begin firing any moment now. The last gate was narrower than the rest, and on either side lay the crumpled the wrecks of careless drivers gone before. Horses, driven so harshly, blind and insane with terror, would simply plow into the stone columns if the hand at the reins was careless or unsteady. The driver split his attention between the Roc, which had now circled around again for another diving pass and controlling his steeds. His guiding hand was cramping and felt as though on fire, knotted into the leather, it would be useless after this for several days. But he had made this journey before. As a driver on the open road, he was not easily rattled - and he was being well paid for his troubles.

He had been counting his bullets, firing the last just as he entered the split second sactuary of the narrow last arch. He cast down the weapon and took up the hand flare, ripping it into fire with his teeth on the pullcord. He shoved the sputtering geyser of light into a holder and struck the lash over the wet, flayed backs before him. They would fetch a price at any of the city factories when this was all over. And when coupled with his remaining fee, it would be enough to purchase another pair for the return. Now if only the cannons would sound.

The Roc, seeing its prey in the open, drew up high into the sky, preparing for a final, killing pass. It flapped its terrible wings, shedding old tattered plastic feathers and trailing loose cabling. It hung in the sky for a beat, the grace of the motion as beautiful as a stalled airship, then it tilted down to begin its plummet, drawing itself inwards to go faster. It fell out of the sky as a heavy black drop of petroleum. Unable to keep from screaming, it opened its beak for a last, maddening, screeching howl.

The first volley was not quite on target, but it did graze the great bird, enough to startle it from its dive. Its keen lethal grace flustered into a sudden squawking mess of flapping and backpedalling. However momentum carried it forward and it still brushed over the fleeing coach, close enough for the driver to smell it. Old flesh and exhaust fumes roaring by. The horses lurched to the side in a panic, taking them all off-road. Inside, the cabin tossed about.

"Gah! Did you hear that, sir? The cannons! They see us!"

Tangled in his robes, the older man struggled upright. His book had slipped from his fingers and closed itself, losing his place. He scowled at this.

"I've lost my place."

"What? Sir, are you alright? There - again!" And indeed, the cannons could be heard booming in the distance, followed by a low crunching thud close by. The driver cackled loudly in his way, regaining control over the horses and making their way back onto the hardpacked road. They were safe.

The Roc flew in crazy turns, outraged and confused as each shot found its mark. Bits of broken machinery rained down each time until it finally turned and withdrew back into the desert, dripping gouts of dark fluid from its matted plumage.

It was not long before they were within the shadow of the city. Formed by the intensity of the glow beyond, the shadow of Dis reached outward from the walls and sheltered a surrounding tent village. Here lived those too poor to dwell with the protective lead walls and palaces. And here suffered those exposed, even in shadow, to the glow beyond.
## A brief tale of plenty

A BRIEF TALE OF PLENTY 

Once upon a time, deep in the woods under towering trees, black with damp bark, there sat a small village of mice. It was a quiet place for quiet lives; safely tucked away in the thickest, darkest, most serene spot in the forest.

The mice there never wanted for anything. For surrounding their village, dusk and dawn, were nut trees and berry bushes and grasses heavy with dew.

The village was called Plenty, and its citizens were happy indeed. All, that is, except for one small boy of a mouse, named Stem.

Stem didn't much care for the quiet serenity of Plenty. It was boring. Nothing ever happened that didn't happen the day before. He went about his chores with a wayward eye into the gloom of the surrounding forest and the promise of a larger, more exciting world beyond.

"I'm going to leave this little knothole," Stem would say, "Someday soon." And he meant it.

"Me too," would say his little brother, Twig, who thought that Stem was the greatest person in all the world.

"Eee-doo," would say their littlest sister, Pollen, who learned that she had toes just a few days ago.

Mother never let any of them leave Plenty, however. She warned them about the Dangers of the Forest. Things like Owls and Ferrets, Foxes and Snakes - monsters that ate stray little mice, whiskers and all!

Unlike his siblings, Stem wasn't afraid of monsters. He was skilled as a warrior and practiced his swordplay everyday after finishing his chores.

"I am Stem the Mighty," he would cry, before charging into battle, "Har!"

"I'm mighty, too," would cry Twig, his squire.

"Eye-dee-doo!" cheered Pollen.

The monsters always begged for their lives, but Stem was merciless.

"I bet my trusty sword and I could make the Forest safe for all mice!" he boasted.

"And my dagger!" agreed Twig.

"Why, we'd be doing the village a favor if we went out and made all the Owls, Ferrets, Foxes and Snakes leave for good!" said Stem.

"Yeah, we'd be heroes!" agreed Twig.

"Beedy ear-ohs!" agreed Pollen.

And so, the three fearless warriors decided they would save the Forest - after lunch and maybe a nap.

The tendancy to relate the shell to a more locally familiar analogous object is interesting, and perhaps the truth of the matter is that the shell/horn is an intermediate mix of all known descriptions.

All accounts mention a widening spiral that leads to the twin openings for the hands. And the defining similarity is that the shell itself is made of a cloudy, dense, crystalline salt which does not melt. It is unclear exactly how the shell functions, for there is no meaningful agreement among the various sources. Some stories describe the shell simply as a means to shackle the violently insane, specifically those possessed by occult forces. Other tales refer to it as a "water shaping" tool useful for anything from catching fish to battling whales to smoothing away tidal waves. It is apparently also useful for dowsing and rainmaking. In one instance, the wearer was able to determine the truthfulness of those who spoke in her presence.

All this is severely taxing upon the user who is quite trapped within the shell anywhere from a few hours to several days. During this time, the blood from the user fills the spiral cavity inside. At some point the shell releases its connection and the user is able to withdraw his hands. It may be that the blood itself triggers this. If the device is purely an inert object, perhaps the accumulation of blood disrupts some inner mechanism. The wounds sustained by wearing the Saltshell are unanimously described as maiming and disfiguring; more than a few of the myths make poetic use of this by having the wearers be artisans of some sort, or dancers, and thereafter unable to follow their trade. By contrast, the scars themselves are apparently quite beautiful and are seen by many as an honorific consolation for the mangled hands. In some cultures during times of festival, parents will mimic this scarring pattern on the hands of their children using stains and other pigments to temporarily mark the skin. These designs vary, but are always elaborately detailed..."
## In the hall of the rat king

IN THE HALL OF THE RAT KING

Thunder rolled outside; the sound ponderously unraveling its low heavy grinding like teeth at a bone.

"I want to go home!" Exclaimed Twig, who had simply reached his limit. The City might still be a place of wondrous high adventure, but for the small mouse he wanted nothing more than the savory tedium of warm mash and the spiced corn cider of Home. These things were probably steaming away on the potbelly stove right now; the same tonight as they would have been last night, and again tomorrow. He missed his scratchy old scarf and his paper pirate hat. He missed his Mama.

Twig sank to the rubbled floor and burst into great sobs. At this, Stem crouched low beside his younger brother, removed Twig's gaudy cityfolk cap, and stroked his ears gently - ears canted back to the sounds of the storm beyond the walls.

"There, there, Twiggy. You know we have to find Pollen, first. The Crow said she would have been taken this way and I can't believe it's much further. Once we're all together again, then.. Well, then we can figure out how to get out of this awful place." Twig sniffled against Stem's fine strange jacket and shook with emotion, burrowing his muzzle into his brother's arms. The receding, wailing, small face of their baby sister blotted out all else in his mind.

"Oh Pollen! I'm so sorry Stem, I didn't mean what I said! I didn't mean it! I wish she were back, and I wish we were home-"

"Hush. Shhh, that doesn't matter now," said Stem, and the brave mouse stood up, pulling Twig with him to his feet. He threw aside the boy's jangling cap and quickly shucked the velvet coat from his shoulders. "None of this does now. This place clouded our heads, even Polly's. I don't blame you for what happened, but if we're all going to see home again, then I'm going to need you to be steady and keen." Stem squared the smaller mouse's shoulders and faced him nose to nose, "Can I count on you, squire?"

At this, Twig's fur bristled nose to tail and he swallowed thickly, his eyes blinking and intent though still red with wet tears. He rubbed his nose with the back of his paw and offered a salute. "Aye-aye, Cap'n Sire Sir!" Stem held his gaze long enough to steel his brother and then they embraced as a small hard kernel of unassailable Family.

"Bravo!" Exclaimed a gruff voice from the surrounding shadows. The two mice startled, but then Stem quickly stooped to gather a sizable pebble of fallen plaster into his fist. Twig put his back to his brother's and together they scanned the gloom.

"Who said that?" cried Stem.

"Sh-show yourself!" ordered Twig. Although moonlight poured in through the jagged leaking holes in the ceiling and around the haphazardly nailed boards in the windows, the abandoned museum was still largely cast in darkness. Strange shapes in strange paintings hung at strange angles from the walls, confronting them with inscrutable menace. The two mice spun around slowly, for the first time trying to make sense of their surroundings. Somewhere in the vast hall, rubble crashed and skittered. The scratching of claws on the stone floor echoed about them, coming closer though seemingly from all around.

"...Stem?" whispered Twig, his tail curling about his brother's.

"Stay close, fine squire." Stem raised his hunk of plaster.

"Who goes there? We are Stem and Twig of the Smallpaw Knights from the fair land of Plenty. We are on a righteous quest and we are unafraid!"

To which the scuttling claws scratched to a halt and again the gruff voice reverberated, close enough to flicker their whiskers. The stranger chuckled, "Well met, good sirs.. tally-ho and whathaveyou.. Stay your hand there, son." Twig squinted and made out what looked to be several gleaming eyes looming from a shadowy figure. He reached for Stem's paw and tugged, "Stem.. Look there!"

Into their small pool of moonlight stepped a rat, and not just any rat, but the swaggering pomp of the Rat King.

"It's him!" blurted Stem. And indeed it was, though from what the Crow had described, the boys were expecting something frankly bigger and more kingly. As he came closer, it was seen that the rat's famed many eyes were none other than a queer set of multi-lensed spectacles. His grand harpoon, with which the Crow had sworn "'Pon his pinions" that the King could use to bring down the stars was nothing more nor less than a fantastic writing stylus like they'd already seen. Jostling about the rat's person were bulging pockets and pouches of tools and gadgets, and slung around his neck was a domino mask of peculiar design; perhaps spectacles as well. In fact, though the rat before them fit the bird's exaggerated description, he inspired not so much fearsome awe as bemused curiosity. Stem lowered his missile.

"You're the Rat King!" said Twig, his fears forgotten and a broad toothy smile spreading across his face. He clapped giddily and dashed over and around the man, almost tripping over the rat's thick tail. Slung across his back by a sturdy strap was a sleek black cylinder, metallic and engraved with symbols. Twig twittered,

"Ooh! And this is your Sun Cannon! We've heard of you! Stem it's really him! Now he can rescue Pollen for us, destroy the Dragon, drive back the roaches, release Percy from his curse, and - and - and we can go home!" Twig hopped about from one foot to the other, dancing a little happy jig. Beset by the small mouse's sudden enthusiasm, the rat wobbled about, almost tripping over him.

"Hey now, easy there, fireball! What's this? Dragon? Wha-?" He gently pushed Twig to arm's length away with a long finger to the mouse's forehead. He sat down on his haunches to look levelly at the two boys and rubbed his jaw in appraisal.

"Excuse my brother, sir." Stem approached and pulled the grinning Twig to his side, "Are you indeed the Rat King?" The rat raised an eyebrow and glanced around briefly, then set down his polearm and, with a grunt, unshouldered the heavy black cylinder from his back. He sniffed and knuckled his glasses up his snout.

"I've been called a great many things, little man; some more deserved than others. I take it you've been chatting with crows or pigeons or somesuch, the birds tend to exaggerate. Now supposing I am this Rat King, what may I do for you two stray souls?" He put both hands on the end of his black device and turned slowly. The cylinder's glass eye lit up, casting a beam of warm dusty light up to the far reaches of the ceiling. He had them all settle in its glow and fed them with cracker crumbs and bits of licorice from his own rations. The rat addressed them as young equals, not merely children, and his reassuring, grown-up presence did much to soothe their tired spirits after so much tragedy and anxious excitement.

Stem (with Twig's occasional interruptions until his brother finally drifted to sleep, slumped against the rat) recounted their whole twisting tale from the Forest to the River, from the River to the Sewer, and from the Sewer up through the City itself. The Rat King listened attentively, rubbing his whiskers, exclaiming in surprise at the plight of the roaches, and in distress at the pending fate of poor Pollen. When at long last Stem mentioned their stumbling out of the storm and into the museum, the stoic little mouse seemed on the verge of exhaustion and tears. After he had finished, the Rat King sat in thoughtful silence for a long time, gnawing at his licorice. Then,

"I think, Mr. Stem, that you should rest... There'll be time enough to decide what can be done in the morming, under clearer skies."

While it wasn't his mother, having someone tell him to go to bed was the most welcome, normal thing that the boy could've hoped for, and he nodded, curling up next to his brother under the watchful eye of not only their new friend but the grotesqueries of once modern art; flickering on dimly lit walls, many in tatters wet from the rain.
## Rooftop encounter

ROOFTOP ENCOUNTER

"Where's home, then?" asked the Rat King. He asked over his shoulder, glancing back at the three children. They trailed behind him, picking their way carefully through the the rooftop rubble, one after the other like little ducklings. It had been a long, full day, and the young mice were clearly exhausted. The excitement of their reunion wore off quickly when it became clear that they were all still quite deep in dangerous territory. It was already late twilight, and before they could rest safely. There was much ground still left to cover by nightfall. The King kept up a steady chatter as a means of distraction.

"Nowhere near here," Twig muttered, and his older brother cut in.

"In the woods, sir. In a forest with great big tall trees."

"Like those there?" The rat nodded to the side. From their vantage atop whatever building this was, they could see a patch of swaying green branches among a range of peaked roofs. The rat paused and leaned on his flashlight, taking a break. The eldest boy could likely keep going at this pace, but his two siblings were in need of a rest. The rat slung down his pack and started to fumble with the knots, speaking, "We've got trees here too. Tame, behaved things, and we call them 'parks'."

"My feet," whimpered Pollen, tugging at Stem's shirtsleeve. He stooped and hugged her. From his bag, the rat fished out something wrapped in newspaper and handed it to the little girl. "Here, Miss Pollen. It might be a little bruised, but it'll do you. Mind your dress."

"Fankoo," she took it with a meek smile and flopped down with it in her lap like Christmas morning. It was a small blueberry.

Twig snorted and kicked a pebble off the ledge, "Our trees at home are big as giants, with acorns they toss like boulders on windy days."

"You don't say," The rat flicked his ears and rummaged out another parcel. He handed it to Twig with a grunt, "I think that's the dried cake. You can share it with your brother, though you might want to save some for later."

While they ate, the Rat King slung his flashlight across his back and scrambled up a drooping clothesline. He scanned the horizon, particularly in the direction of the park.

"And are there any birds in your forest, Mister Twig?"

"Of course! Hawks that blot out the sun in passing; and at night, owls as big as dragons!"

Stem jabbed his elbow into Twig's side. Twig stuck out his tongue. Meanwhile, Pollen had not only finished her berry, but she had successfully managed to stain her entire muzzle, her hands up to each elbow, most of her dress and all of her toes.

"Done done!" she proclaimed with a clap.

Twig snorted, "Polly you look like a raccoon!" She blinked and only then seemed to notice her mess.

"And the King looks like a monkey!"

Above them, the rat had twined the clothesline around himself and his flashlight securely. He kicked and swung about, working the switch on and off and spinning round and round in a most curious manner.

Though engrossed in this task, he lashed his tail and pressed his crooked crown firmly onto his head.

"That's King Monkey to you, Mister Twig... for you shall... shortly see..."

He huffed and wobbled precariously, twisting about, "...what mastery I have over... the creatures in... my dominion."

"What's he mean by that?" Twig snorted. And then Pollen, who had been trying diligently to lick her fingers clean, stood up and pointed with a giddy squeal. Up from the green island of the park rose a smudge against the dim sky that blebbed and flowed smoothly through the air. It seemed to drift as smoke briefly before banking in a sharp turn directly towards them. Rushing closer, the shape resolved into several dozen pigeons, the flock of which moved as a single beast. They erupted over the rooftop, low enough so that the children felt the wake of their wings. Pollen hopped up and down giggling and clapping.

They quickly gathered their belongings and met the flock as it landed in a clearing of sorts, surrounded by chimneys, stacked flowerpots, empty beer bottles and other forgotten things. The pigeons perched every where they could fit and shouldered up against each other, rustling about softly. They were sleek, fat birds, in mottled greys and occasionally streaked with green or blue. In moments all were profoundly silent.

The Rat King strode into the middle of their gathering and met with one of them that was particularly distinguished looking. It bobbed its head this way and that, turning it from side to side to watch his approach. At about a pace away, the rat stopped and bowed deeply. The bird curtsied in return and addressed him in low tones like an old, dusky, wooden flute.

"King Rat of The Grey Gutter, He of The Clever and Cunning Hands, Gardener of Secrets and Patron to All Who Traffic in Escape, Hope, and Solace in This Age of Concrete... You have summoned us."

The rat responded, "Beautiful Columba Livia, Merciful Dove and The Zephyr of God, Demure and Swiftly Fleeting Herald to The Urban Eschaton in This, Our Age of Concrete... I am blessed by your reply."

They both genuflected again, then suddenly rushed to embrace each other like old friends, chortling and laughing loudly. The bird dipped her head and nipped at his crown, in return he buried his face into her plumage and embraced her affectionately. The other birds relaxed from their somber audience and began to groom themselves, or hop about, pecking at grit and cooing musically.

"Livia! You old biddy, how long has it been? It feels like I haven't seen you in months!" He slung his arm around her and guided her over to the three little mice. She fluffed and tugged at his whiskers with her beak, giggling.

"Oh, Ratty, you devil! It's been simply forever, hasn't it? Well, I've been so busy lately. 'The early bird catches the worm' and all that."

"As long as that's all you catch!" He replied, pointing to her.

"Any worm in a storm!" She blurted, and they fell into each other laughing again, almost teary-eyed.

Stem cleared his throat and gamely offered a smile. Twig rolled his eyes. Pollen was more or less satisfied that her hands were more or less clean, if tasty.

Eventually the two adults calmed down and the rat gestured to his charges, "Livia, I'd like you to meet some new friends of mine. These mice are from the Woods." He nodded meaningfully to the bird and she stepped closer, working her neck around to see them all closer.

"What adorable little chicks you all are!"

"I'm Stem, Missus Columba Livia. And this is my brother, Twig, and our sister, Pollen."

"Hi!" said Pollen, stained from ears to tail.

"Tsk, why you're as ruddy as a ruby, dear! And is that blueberry juice? Ratty, are you taking care of these children or making them into pies for the Cats?" She smirked at him and he blushed, visibly flustered.

"Heh heh, very funny Livia; I would never. Actually, I'm trying to get them home." The pigeon looked at him blankly. He tried again, "As in: out of the city. Today, if possible. Before it gets any darker and it comes to things like cats."

"I'm not afraid of any cats!" interjected Twig.

"You've never met any cats," his older brother quipped, "None of us have."

The bird looked them all over again with more serious appraisal, "I see. Well, don't you worry dears, you're in good hands with Ratty. And I think we can help you back to your arboretum or whatever it is."

The rat grinned and winked to Twig, "What'd I tell you... Stick with The King, eh?" The pigeon turned to him slyly, "Oh really? Well, your Majesty... I'm assuming the usual fee is in order, mmm?"

"Aha!" The Rat King held up a finger for her to wait. He curled his tongue over his nose and dug around in his sack, searching vigorously until a knowing smile marked his success. He withdrew a ball of wadded pink tissue paper. At the sight of this, the bird became particularly agitated and she tried to peck it from his hand.

"Ratty! Give it to me! Open it for me, quickly!" He shushed her soothingly while slowly unfolding the wad. This revealed a rather mashed, fragrant, lumpy object which he jostled enticingly in the middle of its crinkling pink nest. He then presented this to her gravely, as though bearing divine mana within rare rose petals. She greedily snapped it up and lept into the air with a flourish, quickly drawing the other pigeons after her.

"What was that?" asked Stem.

The rat tossed the paper back into his bag, "Her weakness, Mister Stem. And your ticket out of here: popcorn from the Bayside Omniplex Theater. Nine screens, real butter, powdered cheese, kosher salt."

He could see that his words meant nothing to the boy and he ruffled his headfur playfully, "I'll take you there, one day. Look out, here they come."

It was that liquid cloud of churning dull feathers, and it circled the building before pouring down onto them in a torrent. One by one, rat and mice were caught up into careful talons and whisked away into the dizzying heights above the streets, the pavement.
## The radiation fragment

THE RADIATION FRAGMENT

 

Stem shook violently, his fingers curled into fists around the rags of his siblings. He stood up from the rubble and twisting wroughtwork and it hurt all over to do so. The mouse was brave but still only a mouse and his muscles were worn thin. Rain poured in through in the ruined cathedral and sizzled on the stone floor. The water stung his flayed hide. It was a dirty rain, heavy with ashes and acids. A cemetary rain of muck into open graves. Around him the scattered pews, each massive and oaken, lay tumbled up on each other in splinters as forgotten as toy soldiers. They were ancient, solidly hewn and well crafted. But the intensity of the blast had bent them as easily as soft green grass. As the rain pelted the upturned ends, the figures carved there seemed to cry in raised, glowing devotion.

The mouse stood up from the rubble and his knees immediately gave way, collapsing as though jelly. He crawled away from the center of the vast chamber and propped himself against a spiralling column.

"Show yourself!" He cried, feeble and spent. His throat was raw and he coughed out black blood, "Show yourself, you coward! I have - I have bested your Champion and I demand an audience!" But his words echoed into the rain and were lost.

He bled all over: from his pores, his eyes, within his gut. He doubled over in pain and the blistering skin on his back split and sloughed away. He sobbed against the hard wet floor. A section of the roof fell in, collapsing under its own soggy weight. It would not be long before the whole holy fortress dissolved away into sundered bricks and ashes. The heavy rains. The thunder rolling and racing through the canyons.

He looked through the wet bars of his eyelashes and saw across the rapidly filling crater that a gargoyle had shattered upon the floor. It lay in pieces, and the spout of its tongue protruded towards him. It looked ridiculous. It was somthing his brother would have laughed at, and so he laughed for him. He rolled onto his back and shuddered with laughter. The water battered his face and pocked the open, doughy flesh of his chest.

He smiled still and his teeth were soft things that he had to turn and spit out onto the floor. But he could not help laughing.

"Little brother, when Mama made you eat your turnips, you would have that expression. Do you remember?" He brought his hands to his face and rubbed the rags there. His nose had clotted shut but he buried his muzzle into the tatters for their lingering scent. He felt his eyes yield and rupture painlessly against his knuckles. He was blind. His tounge felt thick in his mouth.

"And the time Polly ate those grubs," He mumbled and wheezed into laughter, "You dared her, and I bet you a fat berry she wouldn't. But she did, didn't she? Little Pollen. And your face looked like that." He hugged himself into a ball and felt ribs snapping as tinder. Overhead the storm screamed through the exposed timbers and the sky was almost solid with dark water. High above the nave, the vast dome groaned as though a ship at sea. It flaked off its crumbling frescos into tumbling plaster clods. He seemed to feel the floor sliding out from beneath him.

"Mama will be worried about us, my faithful squire," He gurgled through the thin blood flooding his mouth. Strange and sour, metallic water, "We should return home with the princess. Our queen... She will reward us handsomely - for we are heroes, and it will be supper soon..." He was quiet after that and laid very still.

Over the altar flickered the Vicar's Mark, the eye immutable and unblinking.
## Old twig

OLD TWIG



"Face me, old man. I'm robbing you, see?" The young cat trembles in his boots, blinking against the rain in his face. He winds his fingers around the handle of the knife and tries to steady his paw to show he means business. He's been following the mouse all afternoon and here, in the rain, in this alley, away from the eyes of the city watch but beneath the glow of the Vicar's Sigil upon clouds he makes his move. He scuffles closer, his feet soaked, sniffling and chilled to the bone.

The hunched mouse looks over his shoulder but does not turn around.

"Old man, maybe. But call me Twig, friend." His voice is gentle and he sways his bare tail slowly.

"Shut up and give me that sack," the cat yelps. He carves at the air between them in anxious ragged arcs. Twig falls into a somber, even tone.

"You carry a knife because you are afraid to go unarmed. You think it gives you an advantage that you would not have without it." He now turns, smiling, shuffling in place. "Without it, you think you might not be threatening enough to take from me what is mine. Without it, you think I might resist you."

Twig grunts, standing up straighter, his back aching with the motion. He pulls back the heavy hood and lets the water and the dim Sigil light describe his ruined, withered face. He can see the effect it has upon the boy; a cat with claws and fangs and grace, who has not yet learned that he doesn't need a knife any more than he needs to stick up old men in back alleys. The cat's eyes widen in shock, aghast at the old mouse's flayed features and the dim green pits of his sockets. Twig steps closer, closing the distance.

"Now, you put down that piece of metal and threaten me like a predator, and maybe I'll give you what you want." He mouth curls in a hard, twisted smile and he unslings his sack from his shoulder, still holding it close. The ancient mouse springs with surprising menace upon the boy who falls back another pace, almost stumbling on the slick cobblestones.

"I've been opened by teeth bigger than that laughable toy. When these freakish, wounded holes were still eyes, I saw my sister hanging from talons larger than that child's weapon you clutch as a talisman against what you fear, what you do not understand."

He comes within reach of the cat, whose perfect, clear eyes dart side to side; his ears back, heart pounding.

"But I understand you, boy. I can see your trepidation."

The cat swallows thickly and whispers, "J-just give it to me." They hold each other's gaze for a tense few beats.

Twig scowls. "Bah," he tosses the sack down into the muck of the alley, "Take it before you hurt yourself, bloody fool."

The cat snatches it up and fumbles open the tie, looking inside for his prize. He glances at Twig, regaining a measure of composure, "I saw you earlier today, old man. Trading in the market. I saw the money you made." Twig shrugs, feeling tired and wet. He pulls his hood back low over his face. The cat rummages through the bag, pulling out scraps of paper and rags, feathers, small bones and rubbish. He tosses them aside, digging deeper.

"In my day, a cat was a fearsome creature, a terror along with the owl and the fox."

The cat turns away, ignoring Twig as his fingers find the gold. The smile on his damp face spreads like a stain. Twig continues gravely, closing empty green eyes, "But now, cats carry dull knives in place of claws, stealing like parasites from those they would have previously killed for sport. A cat should be terrible, curious, cunning and aware, but you-"

"What's that? Are you still here?" The cat holds aloft a few heavy coins, his grin catching the rain spattering off them in his palm. He can't look away from their wet lustre.

"Boy, you say you saw me in the market, making money," Twig wraps his mouth around the word like something lewd. "But which market, mmm? And selling what? You mean you didn't notice? You weren't the least bit curious, cat?"

"Creepy old fuck, you must want me to cut you, is that it?" The cat turns the bag over, dumping out a tinkling pile of bones and carved tinder, beaded string fetishes and halfmade dolls. A few folded sheaves of parchment. Crumbs and mementos. There is nothing worthwhile left within, so he lets the rough sack fall away.

"I have your gold and I still have the knife. So mebbie you better get moving before you catch a cold out here in this rain. Or worse." He holds the knife in one hand, the loose coins in the other; the cat feels powerful and wonders whatever could have rattled him about this hunched feeble mouse with the strange empty eyes.

"You are no cat," his scarred muzzle blooms into a cracked toothy smile. The cat hisses and charges him, putting the knife to his neck, his arm across Twig's chest to pin him against a near wall. Twig struggles, chuckling even as he fights for breath.

"No, of course not. Not curious at all, not you. Ignorant whelp, you cast down the treasure and the power for mere gold," Twig laughs, wheezing, infuriating the feline to prick the rodent's old skin with the tip of his blade.

Behind him the writhing demon of sinew and sackcloth, sloppy in the rain, tangles its tatter fingers in heavy wet loops around the cat's throat and face, unfurling into his mouth and pulling him off of its master. It quickly twines about his screaming head, smothering him in the filthy trashwater. In his panic, the cat jabs at his own face, slicing through the coarse rags with his knife; his knife when his claws would do. His eyes open, runny under the blade, his nose splits along the muzzle over and over. Blood seeps into the cloth and he gurgles through muffled layers of tightening burlap, flopping on the ground in the endless cold rain until dead.

Twig slumps over, panting, grabbing his chest, his heart dancing madly. He moans over the roar of the rainfall, squinting up at the dull eye of the Vicar's Sigil floating against the clouds, bright as the moon.

"You certainly took your time, demon," he manages to say. The creature unravels itself, coiling into shape of a lithe whiplash ragdoll. The cat's head is crushed to pulp, messy in spreading puddles. The demon lopes about the alley, picking up the spilled goods and swallowing them away. It bows and scrapes, genuflecting and simpering.

"A thousand apologies, master. Of course I am only bound to protect you from harm. So I could do nothing until he drew the smallest drop of your sweet, precious blood." It speaks with the harsh ripping sound of linens for burial, war trench tourniquets, honeymoon nightgowns and stillborn swaddlings. Rags in the mouths of all those muffled and shot. Blindfolds on babes, unable to keep their balance in the back of swerving black vans. Torn red national flags snapping in the wind, banners on battlefields. Butcher's smocks and menstrual wadding. Sacks of traitors' gold and moneylenders' magic. It speaks and rips its mouth anew each time, only to have the threads reweave themselves in silence. The demon gorges itself on all it can carry and then it falls quiet; again an ordinary, rough bag at Twig's feet. The old mouse takes up the weight onto his shoulder and sops a hand over his slick face, sniffing back rainwater. He shrugs deeply into his cloak and shuffles out of the alley.

"Dealing with demons will be my undoing, brother," he says aloud.

MACON COUNTY, ROUTE 13



The Vicar's Man-o-War is driving a blue black muscle car a thousand miles an hour on ragged two-lane asphalt, tearing noisily through rural Macon County, Alabama; it is well after midnight. I hide in the back, down in the footwell, and when I look up I see the churning blur of black trees against the moonlit sky. Muddy Waters is on the radio, distant and tinny.

He reaches back with ribbony fingers, long tentacles which caress my damp face. The car seat groans with his motion, the worn leather stretching and creaking.

I curl up into a ball and try to hide my head but I can feel his touch on my neck. The sense of hurtling speed is making me ill. As we crest each rise, my stomach seems to float uneasily. I am cold and terrified.

The car roars like a dragon, but it's not loud enough to mask his strange choral moans; subsonic whale sounds, booming and squealing over rangy delta blues. Tears arc across my cheeks to gather at the corners of my mouth, and I can't help but taste them. Mingled with his metallic sea smells, my tears bring to mind the ocean, and I clamp my lips tightly. I will not let him in. I am not going to drown. My throat is tight, and my heart is pounding.

He tilts back his opened hardshell face and bellows deeply. From the blowhole in his chest flecks of spittle and hot cetacean air rustle into the car. Without seeing it, I know that the windshield glass blurs across with his dank breathing. I have done this myself before and written my name in the bloom with my finger. I fear we will crash.

There is a bottle-glass green glow from the dashboard, and also the moon; it's not enough to keep away shadows, and so the car is dense with them, gloomy and crowded. Rocking to myself, I sob quietly while the shadows watch. It seems this night can only end in a fireball.

One song fades and another begins, while faster and faster the shapes outside stream by. We go charging and swerving along. I peek to see his head lolling back and I wonder how it is that we haven't yet careened into a ditch or a thick, sudden oak. His groans and slow gurgles reverberate fathoms deep, and he rolls his head side to side in strange ecstasy as though he were fellated.

In my childhood, I once crept downstairs - not all the way, but enough to spy through the bannister - and I watched my cousins having sex on the couch. They were facing away from me and it looked like this, just his head swaying and hers resting in his lap. I did not understand what I was seeing, and I do not understand it now; the Vicar's Man-o-War is a hermaphrodite with one hand on the wheel and the other still clammy on my nape.

I could open the door and hurtle through it, but I am a coward and the violence of the very idea is paralyzing. I try to make myself as small a possible and I watch the stars above over churning black woods. Soon we reach the highway, and he cuts the wheel to the side, swinging the bully car up the ramp. The road is empty and so no one sees us, no police pull us over. On this broad straightaway he floors it, and the car lunges forward impossibly faster, and then faster still, reaching a speed where the whole machine seems to vibrate. It threatens to simply fly apart, thrumming and trembling. But we are going too fast to crash now; it's unthinkable. Surely anything before us would disintegrate into powder, as before an irresistible force. As before the juggernaut, the Jagannātha, the God-chariot, and to die beneath its wheels is the short ticket to Paradise.

There is the ass that pulls the idol through the city. When those that come to worship and adore his burden bow before it, then the ass mistakenly thinks that they have come to worship him. He struts pridefully all the way to the temple whereupon he stubbornly refuses to obey his master's commands. He is whipped most viciously for this mistaken perspective and sorted back into his proper place; he is meant only to bear the holy load until he is dead, and even then yoked, without the means to fall beneath the very wheels he pulls.

OPELIKA, LEE COUNTY



The Vicar's Man-o-War is cleaning his gun. It is in pieces; heavy metal shapes spread onto the only table in our motel room.

We have been here for hours, sitting in silence. Well, except for the T.V. He doesn't care what is on, so I flip through the channels occasionally.

I'm on the bed. There is just one and I have tried to assert some feeble claim by gathering up all the blankets and such about me. It hasn't worked before, but the cocooning feels better than nothing.

I watch the glowing screen and wait for him to finish. When the weapon is whole and ready, he will bring it with him to the bed and draw it over my skin. These sheets will then unravel placidly, and he will have some form of sex with me.

I drop out of the room when this happens; the television helps.

His gun is a complicated and logical device. I've seen him dissemble and reform it countless times before. I could probably do it myself if I had to. But then I might follow through on the ritual; I might bring it close between my legs and into my mouth.

It is what he does, watching and without fail. It is as though cleaning the gun requires the fear of another to seal the ritual.

On the screen are lights and flickering phantoms. From the corner of my eye, I can see him sorting the assembly together. Those long fingers wrap about once, and then again. His head droops near the gaping void in his chest.

At gunpoint, I've had my hand inside him there; up to my shoulder into the blowhole, with his hot breath gurgling past my bare arm. I've felt the wet grip past my elbow and heard that sound below sound stirring through me.

His whalesong stays with me, though my mind tries to wander away. When I slither out my arm and submit to my own strange, sad turn - even in the most urgent and profoundly dissociative state, I can still hear his whining moans. His wailing rises over my own and then swoops low again. Who is that sorry creature hanging from his limb?

All his bullets have eyes drawn upon them. We are traveling in a car built like a thug, like a heavy fist. Outside it is parked, waiting for us to finish. It is a swollen, wine-dark wave, waiting to bear us further along. It is a machine cooling still from a night of hard driving, and it cares nothing for the soft sounds we make. The motel's neon sign warps warpaint ripples upon the chassis, darkly blue-black as lacquer.

Along with this monster and its rider, the three of us are in motion, swiftly arcing. The Vicar's Man-o-War is the last of His weapons; drawn, wielded and already cutting through the air.
