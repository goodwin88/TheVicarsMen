DEATH

this is how it'll happen:

Death'll come in the form of Josephine Baker, friendly and warm and brown and ever smiling and playful. And it won't be this scary thing, why would it be? just an entertainer from the 30s, from the jazz age and all that earthy physicality and rag. but she'll be southern, like my mama, and she'll take my hand and say a joke or something to break the ice before we go.

and Hanuman will be with her, just in case there's any trouble or need for heroism, but it won't really be Hanuman, it'll be Sun Wu Kung because i always get them mixed up. that won't be important though, because there won't be any trouble; it'll be like going to out to dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while.

and i'll ask if all the people that mattered will be there, my friends and my family, and she'll say she doesn't know but that we could find out together. it'll be just like Neil Gaiman describes except that Death will be Josephine Baker instead of that girl from the comics because Josephine would know all the Billie Holiday songs and could show me a dance or two on the way.
