PRICE OF ADMISSION

In the labyrinth there is the Minotaur.

In yearly tribute it is fed virgins.

Inside they go and lost they get,

until the beast finds them and eats them.

Grendel came to the hall, night after night

and howled outside for the strongest among them.

Each went out, the best and the bravest, and he destroyed them.

Beowulf shows up and rips the creature's arm off.

He beats Grendel with his own bloody stump and drives him away.

Then he nails it over the doorway: "Abandon all hope, ye that enter

for 'ere thar be dragons."

A traveller in winter sees a snake dying by the roadside.

"I will save you. Come with me and I will care for you."

He tucks the creature into his clothing to keep it warm.

It soon writhes with renewed vigor and fatally bites him.

"Why have you done this? I saved you!"

"Fool! You knew I was a snake when you took me in."

The third little pig built his house of bricks, with a sturdy, stout door.

He lived to see that wolf in the soup.

The wolf dropped down the chimney like Santa Claus, right into the pot.

And the piggy made hisself a bully stew, alright.

Here endeth the lesson.

vampires at the threshold, awaiting invitation
