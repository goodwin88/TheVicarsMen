THE TOP

The lovers two spiraled about each other
wobbling swiftly and spinning
two blue stars painted upon a old wooden top
flecked with red and white
    oak worn smooth by the
    hands of children on the floor
    and in the sunlight
this was a gift from grandpa
    flowers in a jar
    set in the open window
    facing the ocean
these were a gift from grandma
linen and sand and
grass and salt and
bottleglass
they both loved the ocean
and in doing so, they
never argued the rest of their
tidal seaside days
