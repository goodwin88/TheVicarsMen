## She of the sea

SHE OF THE SEA

"Look at this one," She held up a pebble the size and shape of old penny candy. It was quite slick from the ocean and dribbled down her fingers. She squinted and smiled to him; her fingers muddy, her feet sandy up to her ankles. He held his flip-flops and her sandals, trailing behind her as she padded along the ocean's edge.

She picked through strewn crabshells and litter, the endless tangles of seaweed, and found small stones like this, flat and smoothed over. She collected them into her hand, making sure to show him each one.

"This one's got a stripe that goes all the way around." And so it did. As they meandered, the ocean crept up to them, each wave thinning and shallow as a puddle after all that crashing noise. Each wave licked at their feet and then just as quickly receeded, slipping back to join the others. The water was too cold for him and he avoided these approaches. However she let the waves rustle luxuriously over her toes and spatter the hem of her skirt.

When the water fell away, she stooped to pluck up another small stone. She held it up as if to see it closer, and then secretly tasted it. He could see this, though she turned to hide the motion from him.

If it were night, she would have stripped and dashed headlong into the deep.

And he would have said lamely, "Here, I'll hold your clothes so they don't get sandy." She would have poured the gathered stones carefully into his hands, handed him her crumpled garments, kissed his cheek and left him blushing and flustered on the shore by the moonlit dark water to watch.
## Galactus and the little prince

GALACTUS AND THE LITTLE PRINCE

So one night, the Little Prince wakes up to find that Galactus is hovering just beyond the tiny sphere of his planet, looking famished.

"GALACTUS MUST FEED" says the grand force of nature, clad in aurora and magenta. His voice booms across the cosmos and snuffs out a dozen stars.

"Mais, ma planète est très petite," says the Little Prince quietly, tying his robe around himself. It is soft and cozy and he is still in his pajamas.

"THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I WILL CONSUME ALL BEFORE ME AND I WILL NOT BE DENIED." Galactus turns his gaze down upon the surface of the small planet and squints his eyes; for it is very small indeed and the Little Prince himself is but a boy.

"Mais monsieur, ma fleur mourra. Je l'aime."

"I AM THE EATER OF WORLDS." They had reached an impasse.

"Ma planète est trop salée et vous n'aimerez pas le goût," proclaims the Little Prince, honestly. He goes to his kitchen for a large spoon and scoops up a heaping of dirt. He offers it to Galactus who looks at him for a long, long time before accepting the sample.

"THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND I AM ETERNAL. IN TIME, I WILL DEVOUR ALL WORLDS. IN TIME, YOURS TOO WILL JOIN ETERNITY IN MY BEING - BUT NOT TODAY. IN TIME, YOU WILL GROW OLD AND DIE. AND IN TIME, YOUR FLOWER WILL WITHER AND DIE WITH YOU. WHEN I RETURN, YOU BOTH WILL HAVE PASSED INTO DUST. I WILL THEN FEED UPON THIS SMALL WORLD AND I WILL THINK OF YOU."

Then the great being Walked Away. He shook terribly with hunger and ground his great teeth, spraying a dozen comets into the void. The Little Prince watched him go. He watered the rose that he loved so dearly and promised to be faithful, and then he shuffled back to bed. He dreamed - not just that night, but thereafter into his old age - of shooting stars and the broad, spanning footprints of gods.
## Death

DEATH

this is how it'll happen:

Death'll come in the form of Josephine Baker, friendly and warm and brown and ever smiling and playful. And it won't be this scary thing, why would it be? just an entertainer from the 30s, from the jazz age and all that earthy physicality and rag. but she'll be southern, like my mama, and she'll take my hand and say a joke or something to break the ice before we go.

and Hanuman will be with her, just in case there's any trouble or need for heroism, but it won't really be Hanuman, it'll be Sun Wu Kung because i always get them mixed up. that won't be important though, because there won't be any trouble; it'll be like going to out to dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while.

and i'll ask if all the people that mattered will be there, my friends and my family, and she'll say she doesn't know but that we could find out together. it'll be just like Neil Gaiman describes except that Death will be Josephine Baker instead of that girl from the comics because Josephine would know all the Billie Holiday songs and could show me a dance or two on the way.
## The vicars champion

THE VICAR'S CHAMPION

The Warrior had no time to waste; smoke from the burning village further blackened the stormy sky above the valley. Distant crashes and cries of battle carried clearly to her on chilling winds. She spurred her mount, digging into its belly, into wounds made from a night of goading and hard riding. The creature was spent and foamed at the mouth, but still it galloped on. She felt it gnawing at the bit. It thrummed between her thighs, broad and powerful, mesmerizing in its way. Only a few more rises and then the drop down into the valley. She did not allow herself to think that she might already be too late. Her legs were numb, her fingers cramping. She held her position just off the saddle, using her knees, digging her heels, her head down and close to the hot neck of the beast, breathing its scent in and out.

She was clearly too late to save the village, but it could not all be cinders yet. She would still find the child as she promised, though dead or alive. But if there was still fighting, there was hope. She was exhausted and her vision blurred, filling with tears from smoke. She trusted the mount to find its own way and simply ground her spurs steadily, mindlessly, whispering along the creature's dank lathered hide to hurry and to fly.

The rhythmic blast of its flecked breath churned out steam into the air. The air was damp and cool here in the highlands; the village could not have burned through completely. Her spurs were catching in the flesh.

"You should not have returned," said the Vicar's Champion, rumbling low and honeyed all around her. Her head pounded with fever, her vision swirled into drizzle and ashes and mud. She clung to the mount with a feeble brittle strength and closed her eyes.

"I made a vow, surely you would understand that," she whispered, rocked gently on thick working muscles. Though they were almost to the crest of the last rise, the melee just beyond it sounded far, far away. Only her heartbeat now, and the thudding gallop, and the stinging burnt air in her lungs.

"You made a vow, but you are pledged to the dead. Even now the fighting is among the victors. Those you would save have been slain. The child you would adore has been consumed. Your purpose here has ended," he said this and she faught back dispair.

"You are not death. My purpose is my own. Can you say the same?"

"I serve my master's will."
## Heather hill

HEATHER HILL

"I'm a blueberry," she said. "See? Look here and say if I'm not."

She held out two small hands, cupping four dusky round berries, dark as navy gems and still wet from the rain. Her face was wet as well, and somewhere far below in the shadows of the grass, her toes twined and curled in the dirt. She was happy and wild; happiest now just after the rains, with the grey clouds still circling and low. I could refuse her nothing. I tried hard to make this image of her - right now - fix itself in my mind.

"It is just as you say," I confessed and she delicately ate them from her palms like they were secrets. All around this hill, the bushes were heavy with them; a multitude of blueberry stars, each in midnight purples against dark green leaves. As she licked her fingers clean, she watched me with interest.

"And you are old tea leaves." Down she squatted, pulling her thin dress over her knees. She hugged herself and rocked in the grass. Cool damp soil, more black now than brown.

"Aren't we a pair," she said and furrowed her brow. The wind kept blowing her hair to her face where it stuck. She shuddered from a chill.

"You will get sick, we should go back inside."

"You worry too much. I don't mind being sick. I can breathe in air like this. Look down into that valley, it is soaked and fresh and cold. All the smothering heat from before is knocked out of the air, rinsed back into the earth." She dropped her fingers to the ground and dug out fistfuls. I would not have been surprised to see her eat from them. She ground her fingers together so the mud fell away in clods.

"We won't have many more days like this. And so what if I get sick? If I do, it will be because this day has entered into me bodily, and I rather fancy that notion. My disease would last as a testament, long after the clouds have gone."

"Well then, I will get sick." She glanced up at me as though I had insulted her.

"No you won't. You are immune; you resist all these charms."

"All but yours."

"Yes," she smiled, and it was again all right. We filled our pockets with more berries and wandered down into the valley to play among the old cannons and ruined concrete bunkers. When the sun did finally burn through, it found us perched upon a crumbling dome, watching the fading storm clouds on the horizon. We strained our ears in serious, devotional silence, and sought to hear - for as long as we could - the low and fading thunder.

## Fiction by the numbers by the sea

FICTION BY THE NUMBERS, BY THE SEA

Tracy was on the case.

Franklin "The Fist" Jones, a hopeful with dreams of a shot at the title.

It seems while Jones was bringing home nickels and old fish from his job at the docks or beating patched sacks of sand at the gym, his younger brother Timbo was living the fast life. Too fast. And now he needed help; he was in over his head in debt to local shark and dilettante, Glitterface.

"How much do you owe, Timbo?"

"More than you got, but I've got this plan, see?"

Timbo had a gun, it was their old man's service revolver. And with the old man long since dead in a box, Timbo felt the pistol might as well see the light of day.

"Where'd you get that, Timbo?"

"Aw, you know Ma kept this on the shelf in her closet. It'll be easy, nobody has to get hurt. Look, it's empty!"

"Don't point that at me. I don't like this; I could just get another job."

"Save your strength, killer. I know you do rounds on the weekend. You work too hard as it is. Get a little more sleep and you'll dodge that fist a little quicker next time, eh?"

He chuckled and Jones looked away, the shiner still raw on his face from the night before.

"I won that fight, Timbo."

"Sure you did. Now listen, big brother: here's what we need to do."

Timbo had a plan, a heist; simple and easy.

And as Jones listened, watching his brother's eyes dance with cunning and the way he fingered the cylinder on the gun he remembered the two of them as boys, skinny and nervous by the deathbed of their father. That flabby hand on his shoulder and those eyes that'd seen too much war.

"You, my son. My eldest. You are the man now. Watch over your mother and Timothy." The hand in his hair and then folded over the other on that rattling chest, eyes closing, "My good boy."

The gun wasn't even loaded, nobody would get hurt.

Wobbles drove the car. Jones and Timbo went in, easy as you please. Tim had a grin on his face the whole time. He was jovial about it, joking around with that iron in his hand. Jones had a baseball bat. He felt ridiculous and terrified, wearing his mother's hose over his face and asking some pretty piece to put the money in the bag. The teller looked at him with utter fear in her face and he felt the old man's hand in his hair, his thumb rubbing his forehead.

But he was a fighter and he tamped all that down and shook his fist to get her moving.

"That's it, champ. Way to handle the ladies." Timbo was laughing, waving the gun at the guard. He hadn't been drinking, but he was drunk all the same. The rush of it all. "That's my brother. He's going to make the papers, one day," he said, then cackled, "and not just for this!"

And they were in and out. Mere minutes. Wobbles cranked the wheel this way and that, yapping to Timbo who still had the gun in his hand. He couldn't keep his eyes on the road, he kept looking at the cash. Timbo had dumped the bag into his lap and was rocking back and forth with it. The two of them like jackals.

Jones slumped deep into the back seat and looked at the bricks and steel swirl by. His head was pounding, his black eye pulsing and tender. Later that night he was home cooking for his mother, and later, sitting in prayer with her.

Tracy was on the case. Witnesses described two men, one was a talker, kind of a weasel, the other a brute with a bat. Scuffed knuckles and a black eye. The teller remembered his hands. Someone else remembered the "champ". He was a detective and he was on the case. In little time, the police were snooping around, dropping in to the gyms around the city and asking about fighters.

But it was all settled, they'd gotten away clean and nobody knew nothing. So when the coppers came around he lied with a straight face. He was in the ring, pounding on Sully for practice. Both had the headgear on. He was heated and loose, he spit to the side and gave his alibi. On his way out, Tracy wished him luck with his local title fight. He knew something, alright. He knew nothing, of course. Jones was rattled.

And of course, that wasn't the end of things. With the robbery, nothing was settled. Glitterface was happy to get his money back, but he was no fool. It was in all the papers. And who owns the banks? The mob. The mob had a hand in everything, and some punk with a gun wasn't going to last long stealing their hard-earned bankvaulted cash. But to someone like Glitterface, Timbo had his uses. To deliver Timbo into the right hands might make a don or two a little grateful, might earn a few favors, down the road.

"A pleasure doing business with you, Timbo, a real pleasure," he said, with oil and promise in his voice.

Jones was furious. There in the kitchen with Timbo and Wobbles, the two of them dressed in ridiculous fashions.

"Hey, keep it down, killer. You don't want to wake Ma, do you?"

"How can you be working for that trash, now? Just last week he was going to break your legs."

"It was business, big brother."

"Is that what you are, now? You two businessmen?"

Timbo had a plan. And bullets; this time the old man's gun was loaded.

The fights kept him busy, kept him keen and numb at the same time. And he kept winning. He came home to find his mother asleep in front of the radio and he kissed her forehead. She woke with the voice of a child and called him by his father's name. The wins came, the honest prize money came. He needed to smuggle home fish less and less.

Then, across the hall, this dame moved in - No, not a dame - that would've been Timbo's word for a woman. And she was too mousey and plain for all that, anyway. But there she was and they both fumbled awkwardly around each other in passing on the stairs. She wore a cross and no wedding ring.

"Franklin, come and see who's here." His mother was sitting with her on the couch. He was just in from training. He was sapped and bruised and felt too big for the small apartment. She was sitting there with his mother and they were holding hands.

"Franklin, look. This is Mary, she lives right across the hall. Isn't that funny? I made such a fool of myself today with the groceries and she was kind enough to help me. Oh, we've been talking all evening!"

Jones grunted and pulled his hat from his head.

"That's great Ma," then to her he nodded, "Miss."

"Franklin works by the water, dear."

And life went on accordingly. Eventually. Predictably. These arcs are obvious and gracefully simple. Timbo's little schemes get out of hand. He seems to think he's clever and a survivor, but it's only because Jones has always been there to save his ass. He thinks he has it all under control. Wobbles is an idiot, but a loyal follower. Glitterface is brutal and cold-blooded. He strings Jones along, letting him dig his grave a little deeper and using him in the meanwhile to advance his own agenda, eventually turning on him. He finds a way to coerce Timbo into getting Jones to throw his title fight. Perhaps it's the girl. Perhaps it's their mother. There's another heist. This time without Jones. Jones wants nothing more to do with Timbo's "business" ventures. It goes badly, perhaps Wobbles screws up. Somebody is shot but not killed. The threads get only slightly fuzzy after that. But you know the rest, I'm sure. Eventually it all reduces to Jones facing down an oncoming, obliterating, last wide fist to his broken face and deciding to embrace it or not. These things are all about choosing to throw the fight. You enter into and leave this world alone.
