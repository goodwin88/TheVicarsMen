## She of the sea

SHE OF THE SEA

"Look at this one," She held up a pebble the size and shape of old penny candy. It was quite slick from the ocean and dribbled down her fingers. She squinted and smiled to him; her fingers muddy, her feet sandy up to her ankles. He held his flip-flops and her sandals, trailing behind her as she padded along the ocean's edge.

She picked through strewn crabshells and litter, the endless tangles of seaweed, and found small stones like this, flat and smoothed over. She collected them into her hand, making sure to show him each one.

"This one's got a stripe that goes all the way around." And so it did. As they meandered, the ocean crept up to them, each wave thinning and shallow as a puddle after all that crashing noise. Each wave licked at their feet and then just as quickly receeded, slipping back to join the others. The water was too cold for him and he avoided these approaches. However she let the waves rustle luxuriously over her toes and spatter the hem of her skirt.

When the water fell away, she stooped to pluck up another small stone. She held it up as if to see it closer, and then secretly tasted it. He could see this, though she turned to hide the motion from him.

If it were night, she would have stripped and dashed headlong into the deep.

And he would have said lamely, "Here, I'll hold your clothes so they don't get sandy." She would have poured the gathered stones carefully into his hands, handed him her crumpled garments, kissed his cheek and left him blushing and flustered on the shore by the moonlit dark water to watch.
## Galactus and the little prince

GALACTUS AND THE LITTLE PRINCE

So one night, the Little Prince wakes up to find that Galactus is hovering just beyond the tiny sphere of his planet, looking famished.

"GALACTUS MUST FEED" says the grand force of nature, clad in aurora and magenta. His voice booms across the cosmos and snuffs out a dozen stars.

"Mais, ma planète est très petite," says the Little Prince quietly, tying his robe around himself. It is soft and cozy and he is still in his pajamas.

"THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I WILL CONSUME ALL BEFORE ME AND I WILL NOT BE DENIED." Galactus turns his gaze down upon the surface of the small planet and squints his eyes; for it is very small indeed and the Little Prince himself is but a boy.

"Mais monsieur, ma fleur mourra. Je l'aime."

"I AM THE EATER OF WORLDS." They had reached an impasse.

"Ma planète est trop salée et vous n'aimerez pas le goût," proclaims the Little Prince, honestly. He goes to his kitchen for a large spoon and scoops up a heaping of dirt. He offers it to Galactus who looks at him for a long, long time before accepting the sample.

"THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND I AM ETERNAL. IN TIME, I WILL DEVOUR ALL WORLDS. IN TIME, YOURS TOO WILL JOIN ETERNITY IN MY BEING - BUT NOT TODAY. IN TIME, YOU WILL GROW OLD AND DIE. AND IN TIME, YOUR FLOWER WILL WITHER AND DIE WITH YOU. WHEN I RETURN, YOU BOTH WILL HAVE PASSED INTO DUST. I WILL THEN FEED UPON THIS SMALL WORLD AND I WILL THINK OF YOU."

Then the great being Walked Away. He shook terribly with hunger and ground his great teeth, spraying a dozen comets into the void. The Little Prince watched him go. He watered the rose that he loved so dearly and promised to be faithful, and then he shuffled back to bed. He dreamed - not just that night, but thereafter into his old age - of shooting stars and the broad, spanning footprints of gods.
## Death

DEATH

this is how it'll happen:

Death'll come in the form of Josephine Baker, friendly and warm and brown and ever smiling and playful. And it won't be this scary thing, why would it be? just an entertainer from the 30s, from the jazz age and all that earthy physicality and rag. but she'll be southern, like my mama, and she'll take my hand and say a joke or something to break the ice before we go.

and Hanuman will be with her, just in case there's any trouble or need for heroism, but it won't really be Hanuman, it'll be Sun Wu Kung because i always get them mixed up. that won't be important though, because there won't be any trouble; it'll be like going to out to dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while.

and i'll ask if all the people that mattered will be there, my friends and my family, and she'll say she doesn't know but that we could find out together. it'll be just like Neil Gaiman describes except that Death will be Josephine Baker instead of that girl from the comics because Josephine would know all the Billie Holiday songs and could show me a dance or two on the way.
## The vicars champion

THE VICAR'S CHAMPION

The Warrior had no time to waste; smoke from the burning village further blackened the stormy sky above the valley. Distant crashes and cries of battle carried clearly to her on chilling winds. She spurred her mount, digging into its belly, into wounds made from a night of goading and hard riding. The creature was spent and foamed at the mouth, but still it galloped on. She felt it gnawing at the bit. It thrummed between her thighs, broad and powerful, mesmerizing in its way. Only a few more rises and then the drop down into the valley. She did not allow herself to think that she might already be too late. Her legs were numb, her fingers cramping. She held her position just off the saddle, using her knees, digging her heels, her head down and close to the hot neck of the beast, breathing its scent in and out.

She was clearly too late to save the village, but it could not all be cinders yet. She would still find the child as she promised, though dead or alive. But if there was still fighting, there was hope. She was exhausted and her vision blurred, filling with tears from smoke. She trusted the mount to find its own way and simply ground her spurs steadily, mindlessly, whispering along the creature's dank lathered hide to hurry and to fly.

The rhythmic blast of its flecked breath churned out steam into the air. The air was damp and cool here in the highlands; the village could not have burned through completely. Her spurs were catching in the flesh.

"You should not have returned," said the Vicar's Champion, rumbling low and honeyed all around her. Her head pounded with fever, her vision swirled into drizzle and ashes and mud. She clung to the mount with a feeble brittle strength and closed her eyes.

"I made a vow, surely you would understand that," she whispered, rocked gently on thick working muscles. Though they were almost to the crest of the last rise, the melee just beyond it sounded far, far away. Only her heartbeat now, and the thudding gallop, and the stinging burnt air in her lungs.

"You made a vow, but you are pledged to the dead. Even now the fighting is among the victors. Those you would save have been slain. The child you would adore has been consumed. Your purpose here has ended," he said this and she faught back dispair.

"You are not death. My purpose is my own. Can you say the same?"

"I serve my master's will."
## Heather hill

HEATHER HILL

"I'm a blueberry," she said. "See? Look here and say if I'm not."

She held out two small hands, cupping four dusky round berries, dark as navy gems and still wet from the rain. Her face was wet as well, and somewhere far below in the shadows of the grass, her toes twined and curled in the dirt. She was happy and wild; happiest now just after the rains, with the grey clouds still circling and low. I could refuse her nothing. I tried hard to make this image of her - right now - fix itself in my mind.

"It is just as you say," I confessed and she delicately ate them from her palms like they were secrets. All around this hill, the bushes were heavy with them; a multitude of blueberry stars, each in midnight purples against dark green leaves. As she licked her fingers clean, she watched me with interest.

"And you are old tea leaves." Down she squatted, pulling her thin dress over her knees. She hugged herself and rocked in the grass. Cool damp soil, more black now than brown.

"Aren't we a pair," she said and furrowed her brow. The wind kept blowing her hair to her face where it stuck. She shuddered from a chill.

"You will get sick, we should go back inside."

"You worry too much. I don't mind being sick. I can breathe in air like this. Look down into that valley, it is soaked and fresh and cold. All the smothering heat from before is knocked out of the air, rinsed back into the earth." She dropped her fingers to the ground and dug out fistfuls. I would not have been surprised to see her eat from them. She ground her fingers together so the mud fell away in clods.

"We won't have many more days like this. And so what if I get sick? If I do, it will be because this day has entered into me bodily, and I rather fancy that notion. My disease would last as a testament, long after the clouds have gone."

"Well then, I will get sick." She glanced up at me as though I had insulted her.

"No you won't. You are immune; you resist all these charms."

"All but yours."

"Yes," she smiled, and it was again all right. We filled our pockets with more berries and wandered down into the valley to play among the old cannons and ruined concrete bunkers. When the sun did finally burn through, it found us perched upon a crumbling dome, watching the fading storm clouds on the horizon. We strained our ears in serious, devotional silence, and sought to hear - for as long as we could - the low and fading thunder.
