## She of the sea

SHE OF THE SEA

"Look at this one," She held up a pebble the size and shape of old penny candy. It was quite slick from the ocean and dribbled down her fingers. She squinted and smiled to him; her fingers muddy, her feet sandy up to her ankles. He held his flip-flops and her sandals, trailing behind her as she padded along the ocean's edge.

She picked through strewn crabshells and litter, the endless tangles of seaweed, and found small stones like this, flat and smoothed over. She collected them into her hand, making sure to show him each one.

"This one's got a stripe that goes all the way around." And so it did. As they meandered, the ocean crept up to them, each wave thinning and shallow as a puddle after all that crashing noise. Each wave licked at their feet and then just as quickly receeded, slipping back to join the others. The water was too cold for him and he avoided these approaches. However she let the waves rustle luxuriously over her toes and spatter the hem of her skirt.

When the water fell away, she stooped to pluck up another small stone. She held it up as if to see it closer, and then secretly tasted it. He could see this, though she turned to hide the motion from him.

If it were night, she would have stripped and dashed headlong into the deep.

And he would have said lamely, "Here, I'll hold your clothes so they don't get sandy." She would have poured the gathered stones carefully into his hands, handed him her crumpled garments, kissed his cheek and left him blushing and flustered on the shore by the moonlit dark water to watch.
## Galactus and the little prince

GALACTUS AND THE LITTLE PRINCE

So one night, the Little Prince wakes up to find that Galactus is hovering just beyond the tiny sphere of his planet, looking famished.

"GALACTUS MUST FEED" says the grand force of nature, clad in aurora and magenta. His voice booms across the cosmos and snuffs out a dozen stars.

"Mais, ma planète est très petite," says the Little Prince quietly, tying his robe around himself. It is soft and cozy and he is still in his pajamas.

"THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I WILL CONSUME ALL BEFORE ME AND I WILL NOT BE DENIED." Galactus turns his gaze down upon the surface of the small planet and squints his eyes; for it is very small indeed and the Little Prince himself is but a boy.

"Mais monsieur, ma fleur mourra. Je l'aime."

"I AM THE EATER OF WORLDS." They had reached an impasse.

"Ma planète est trop salée et vous n'aimerez pas le goût," proclaims the Little Prince, honestly. He goes to his kitchen for a large spoon and scoops up a heaping of dirt. He offers it to Galactus who looks at him for a long, long time before accepting the sample.

"THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND I AM ETERNAL. IN TIME, I WILL DEVOUR ALL WORLDS. IN TIME, YOURS TOO WILL JOIN ETERNITY IN MY BEING - BUT NOT TODAY. IN TIME, YOU WILL GROW OLD AND DIE. AND IN TIME, YOUR FLOWER WILL WITHER AND DIE WITH YOU. WHEN I RETURN, YOU BOTH WILL HAVE PASSED INTO DUST. I WILL THEN FEED UPON THIS SMALL WORLD AND I WILL THINK OF YOU."

Then the great being Walked Away. He shook terribly with hunger and ground his great teeth, spraying a dozen comets into the void. The Little Prince watched him go. He watered the rose that he loved so dearly and promised to be faithful, and then he shuffled back to bed. He dreamed - not just that night, but thereafter into his old age - of shooting stars and the broad, spanning footprints of gods.
## Death

DEATH

this is how it'll happen:

Death'll come in the form of Josephine Baker, friendly and warm and brown and ever smiling and playful. And it won't be this scary thing, why would it be? just an entertainer from the 30s, from the jazz age and all that earthy physicality and rag. but she'll be southern, like my mama, and she'll take my hand and say a joke or something to break the ice before we go.

and Hanuman will be with her, just in case there's any trouble or need for heroism, but it won't really be Hanuman, it'll be Sun Wu Kung because i always get them mixed up. that won't be important though, because there won't be any trouble; it'll be like going to out to dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while.

and i'll ask if all the people that mattered will be there, my friends and my family, and she'll say she doesn't know but that we could find out together. it'll be just like Neil Gaiman describes except that Death will be Josephine Baker instead of that girl from the comics because Josephine would know all the Billie Holiday songs and could show me a dance or two on the way.
## The vicars champion

THE VICAR'S CHAMPION

The Warrior had no time to waste; smoke from the burning village further blackened the stormy sky above the valley. Distant crashes and cries of battle carried clearly to her on chilling winds. She spurred her mount, digging into its belly, into wounds made from a night of goading and hard riding. The creature was spent and foamed at the mouth, but still it galloped on. She felt it gnawing at the bit. It thrummed between her thighs, broad and powerful, mesmerizing in its way. Only a few more rises and then the drop down into the valley. She did not allow herself to think that she might already be too late. Her legs were numb, her fingers cramping. She held her position just off the saddle, using her knees, digging her heels, her head down and close to the hot neck of the beast, breathing its scent in and out.

She was clearly too late to save the village, but it could not all be cinders yet. She would still find the child as she promised, though dead or alive. But if there was still fighting, there was hope. She was exhausted and her vision blurred, filling with tears from smoke. She trusted the mount to find its own way and simply ground her spurs steadily, mindlessly, whispering along the creature's dank lathered hide to hurry and to fly.

The rhythmic blast of its flecked breath churned out steam into the air. The air was damp and cool here in the highlands; the village could not have burned through completely. Her spurs were catching in the flesh.

"You should not have returned," said the Vicar's Champion, rumbling low and honeyed all around her. Her head pounded with fever, her vision swirled into drizzle and ashes and mud. She clung to the mount with a feeble brittle strength and closed her eyes.

"I made a vow, surely you would understand that," she whispered, rocked gently on thick working muscles. Though they were almost to the crest of the last rise, the melee just beyond it sounded far, far away. Only her heartbeat now, and the thudding gallop, and the stinging burnt air in her lungs.

"You made a vow, but you are pledged to the dead. Even now the fighting is among the victors. Those you would save have been slain. The child you would adore has been consumed. Your purpose here has ended," he said this and she faught back dispair.

"You are not death. My purpose is my own. Can you say the same?"

"I serve my master's will."
## Heather hill

HEATHER HILL

"I'm a blueberry," she said. "See? Look here and say if I'm not."

She held out two small hands, cupping four dusky round berries, dark as navy gems and still wet from the rain. Her face was wet as well, and somewhere far below in the shadows of the grass, her toes twined and curled in the dirt. She was happy and wild; happiest now just after the rains, with the grey clouds still circling and low. I could refuse her nothing. I tried hard to make this image of her - right now - fix itself in my mind.

"It is just as you say," I confessed and she delicately ate them from her palms like they were secrets. All around this hill, the bushes were heavy with them; a multitude of blueberry stars, each in midnight purples against dark green leaves. As she licked her fingers clean, she watched me with interest.

"And you are old tea leaves." Down she squatted, pulling her thin dress over her knees. She hugged herself and rocked in the grass. Cool damp soil, more black now than brown.

"Aren't we a pair," she said and furrowed her brow. The wind kept blowing her hair to her face where it stuck. She shuddered from a chill.

"You will get sick, we should go back inside."

"You worry too much. I don't mind being sick. I can breathe in air like this. Look down into that valley, it is soaked and fresh and cold. All the smothering heat from before is knocked out of the air, rinsed back into the earth." She dropped her fingers to the ground and dug out fistfuls. I would not have been surprised to see her eat from them. She ground her fingers together so the mud fell away in clods.

"We won't have many more days like this. And so what if I get sick? If I do, it will be because this day has entered into me bodily, and I rather fancy that notion. My disease would last as a testament, long after the clouds have gone."

"Well then, I will get sick." She glanced up at me as though I had insulted her.

"No you won't. You are immune; you resist all these charms."

"All but yours."

"Yes," she smiled, and it was again all right. We filled our pockets with more berries and wandered down into the valley to play among the old cannons and ruined concrete bunkers. When the sun did finally burn through, it found us perched upon a crumbling dome, watching the fading storm clouds on the horizon. We strained our ears in serious, devotional silence, and sought to hear - for as long as we could - the low and fading thunder.

## Have no fear

HAVE NO FEAR

A bulb of garlic near the cutting board and a few cloves resting next to it like a squat loving mother with her babes. That's what he thought looking at the small tableau.

"So," he said by way of breaking the silence, "Mama called." Sarah sat at the table while he worked dicing peppers. "While you were asleep."

She exhaled in the direction of the open window and only blinked in reply.

She pulled her foot onto the chair, hanging her toes off the edge, her heel in her crotch. She always smoked in his kitchen because they were siblings and she could get away with it.

He used the flat of the blade to scoop up the cuttings into a bowl and then he started on the onion. The scent was sharp and sudden. The view from the window overlooked the plaza, where youths on ladders hung strings of lanterns and garlands of small piñatas from poles for later that night. Clustered in the shade of the cork tree sat town elders, fanning themselves and slouched. They were jovial, he could tell that much, though at this distance, only tone of voice carried.

"She called and asked about you again, wanted to know how long you were going to stay here." Sarah shrugged and carefully tapped her ashes. She looked at him and he watched his fingers, the garlic nearby like small sugar skulls.

"She said it wasn't right for you to be away like this. Away from your husband." Sarah brushed her hair behind her ear.

"And what did you say?"

"What could I say? 'I don't know', I told her. I said you were still figuring things out. I said you were asleep."

Sarah furrowed her brow, assessing this carefully. She nodded and pulled up her other foot, now sitting crosslegged in the chair. She crushed out her cigarette and then dug both hands into her thick hair and scratched her scalp vigorously.

"Thanks," she mumbled, sighing out a tired grunt. She flopped her hands down into her lap and sniffed.

"What am I going to do? I have to go back for my clothes if nothing else." He nodded and listened; he cut the onion into futher smaller pieces the way he knew she liked it.

## Fiction by the numbers by the sea

FICTION BY THE NUMBERS, BY THE SEA

Tracy was on the case.

Franklin "The Fist" Jones, a hopeful with dreams of a shot at the title.

It seems while Jones was bringing home nickels and old fish from his job at the docks or beating patched sacks of sand at the gym, his younger brother Timbo was living the fast life. Too fast. And now he needed help; he was in over his head in debt to local shark and dilettante, Glitterface.

"How much do you owe, Timbo?"

"More than you got, but I've got this plan, see?"

Timbo had a gun, it was their old man's service revolver. And with the old man long since dead in a box, Timbo felt the pistol might as well see the light of day.

"Where'd you get that, Timbo?"

"Aw, you know Ma kept this on the shelf in her closet. It'll be easy, nobody has to get hurt. Look, it's empty!"

"Don't point that at me. I don't like this; I could just get another job."

"Save your strength, killer. I know you do rounds on the weekend. You work too hard as it is. Get a little more sleep and you'll dodge that fist a little quicker next time, eh?"

He chuckled and Jones looked away, the shiner still raw on his face from the night before.

"I won that fight, Timbo."

"Sure you did. Now listen, big brother: here's what we need to do."

Timbo had a plan, a heist; simple and easy.

And as Jones listened, watching his brother's eyes dance with cunning and the way he fingered the cylinder on the gun he remembered the two of them as boys, skinny and nervous by the deathbed of their father. That flabby hand on his shoulder and those eyes that'd seen too much war.

"You, my son. My eldest. You are the man now. Watch over your mother and Timothy." The hand in his hair and then folded over the other on that rattling chest, eyes closing, "My good boy."

The gun wasn't even loaded, nobody would get hurt.

Wobbles drove the car. Jones and Timbo went in, easy as you please. Tim had a grin on his face the whole time. He was jovial about it, joking around with that iron in his hand. Jones had a baseball bat. He felt ridiculous and terrified, wearing his mother's hose over his face and asking some pretty piece to put the money in the bag. The teller looked at him with utter fear in her face and he felt the old man's hand in his hair, his thumb rubbing his forehead.

But he was a fighter and he tamped all that down and shook his fist to get her moving.

"That's it, champ. Way to handle the ladies." Timbo was laughing, waving the gun at the guard. He hadn't been drinking, but he was drunk all the same. The rush of it all. "That's my brother. He's going to make the papers, one day," he said, then cackled, "and not just for this!"

And they were in and out. Mere minutes. Wobbles cranked the wheel this way and that, yapping to Timbo who still had the gun in his hand. He couldn't keep his eyes on the road, he kept looking at the cash. Timbo had dumped the bag into his lap and was rocking back and forth with it. The two of them like jackals.

Jones slumped deep into the back seat and looked at the bricks and steel swirl by. His head was pounding, his black eye pulsing and tender. Later that night he was home cooking for his mother, and later, sitting in prayer with her.

Tracy was on the case. Witnesses described two men, one was a talker, kind of a weasel, the other a brute with a bat. Scuffed knuckles and a black eye. The teller remembered his hands. Someone else remembered the "champ". He was a detective and he was on the case. In little time, the police were snooping around, dropping in to the gyms around the city and asking about fighters.

But it was all settled, they'd gotten away clean and nobody knew nothing. So when the coppers came around he lied with a straight face. He was in the ring, pounding on Sully for practice. Both had the headgear on. He was heated and loose, he spit to the side and gave his alibi. On his way out, Tracy wished him luck with his local title fight. He knew something, alright. He knew nothing, of course. Jones was rattled.

And of course, that wasn't the end of things. With the robbery, nothing was settled. Glitterface was happy to get his money back, but he was no fool. It was in all the papers. And who owns the banks? The mob. The mob had a hand in everything, and some punk with a gun wasn't going to last long stealing their hard-earned bankvaulted cash. But to someone like Glitterface, Timbo had his uses. To deliver Timbo into the right hands might make a don or two a little grateful, might earn a few favors, down the road.

"A pleasure doing business with you, Timbo, a real pleasure," he said, with oil and promise in his voice.

Jones was furious. There in the kitchen with Timbo and Wobbles, the two of them dressed in ridiculous fashions.

"Hey, keep it down, killer. You don't want to wake Ma, do you?"

"How can you be working for that trash, now? Just last week he was going to break your legs."

"It was business, big brother."

"Is that what you are, now? You two businessmen?"

Timbo had a plan. And bullets; this time the old man's gun was loaded.

The fights kept him busy, kept him keen and numb at the same time. And he kept winning. He came home to find his mother asleep in front of the radio and he kissed her forehead. She woke with the voice of a child and called him by his father's name. The wins came, the honest prize money came. He needed to smuggle home fish less and less.

Then, across the hall, this dame moved in - No, not a dame - that would've been Timbo's word for a woman. And she was too mousey and plain for all that, anyway. But there she was and they both fumbled awkwardly around each other in passing on the stairs. She wore a cross and no wedding ring.

"Franklin, come and see who's here." His mother was sitting with her on the couch. He was just in from training. He was sapped and bruised and felt too big for the small apartment. She was sitting there with his mother and they were holding hands.

"Franklin, look. This is Mary, she lives right across the hall. Isn't that funny? I made such a fool of myself today with the groceries and she was kind enough to help me. Oh, we've been talking all evening!"

Jones grunted and pulled his hat from his head.

"That's great Ma," then to her he nodded, "Miss."

"Franklin works by the water, dear."

And life went on accordingly. Eventually. Predictably. These arcs are obvious and gracefully simple. Timbo's little schemes get out of hand. He seems to think he's clever and a survivor, but it's only because Jones has always been there to save his ass. He thinks he has it all under control. Wobbles is an idiot, but a loyal follower. Glitterface is brutal and cold-blooded. He strings Jones along, letting him dig his grave a little deeper and using him in the meanwhile to advance his own agenda, eventually turning on him. He finds a way to coerce Timbo into getting Jones to throw his title fight. Perhaps it's the girl. Perhaps it's their mother. There's another heist. This time without Jones. Jones wants nothing more to do with Timbo's "business" ventures. It goes badly, perhaps Wobbles screws up. Somebody is shot but not killed. The threads get only slightly fuzzy after that. But you know the rest, I'm sure. Eventually it all reduces to Jones facing down an oncoming, obliterating, last wide fist to his broken face and deciding to embrace it or not. These things are all about choosing to throw the fight. You enter into and leave this world alone.
## Price of admission

PRICE OF ADMISSION

In the labyrinth there is the Minotaur.

In yearly tribute it is fed virgins.

Inside they go and lost they get,

until the beast finds them and eats them.

Grendel came to the hall, night after night

and howled outside for the strongest among them.

Each went out, the best and the bravest, and he destroyed them.

Beowulf shows up and rips the creature's arm off.

He beats Grendel with his own bloody stump and drives him away.

Then he nails it over the doorway: "Abandon all hope, ye that enter

for 'ere thar be dragons."

A traveller in winter sees a snake dying by the roadside.

"I will save you. Come with me and I will care for you."

He tucks the creature into his clothing to keep it warm.

It soon writhes with renewed vigor and fatally bites him.

"Why have you done this? I saved you!"

"Fool! You knew I was a snake when you took me in."

The third little pig built his house of bricks, with a sturdy, stout door.

He lived to see that wolf in the soup.

The wolf dropped down the chimney like Santa Claus, right into the pot.

And the piggy made hisself a bully stew, alright.

Here endeth the lesson.

## The top

THE TOP

The lovers two spiraled about each other
wobbling swiftly and spinning
two blue stars painted upon a old wooden top
flecked with red and white
    oak worn smooth by the
    hands of children on the floor
    and in the sunlight
this was a gift from grandpa
    flowers in a jar
    set in the open window
    facing the ocean
these were a gift from grandma
linen and sand and
grass and salt and
bottleglass
they both loved the ocean
and in doing so, they
never argued the rest of their
tidal seaside days
## Grass

GRASS

They skipped stones by the pond in the dark and to the sound of frogs, crickets, and their own easy banter. They walked along the train tracks by moonlight, one after the other, balanced on the same rail. And then again side by side on both rails, reaching out to touch their fingers together for balance.

They sat on the old slat bridge, dangling their legs above the river and staring downstream to the glowing sky in the distance; the sky above the far, twinkling city.

They rustled about in tall grasses and held each other as the wind swayed the leaves about them and echoed their whispers to each other and to eternity.

They promised to always be friends. Would they spit and shake on it? Yes, and so they did. And they kissed, lightly on the lips and each eyelid. The way mothers kiss their children off to war; the way fathers kiss their daughters.

"My train leaves in the morning, and I can see it's almost dawn."

"Stay with me, please. Here in the tall grass, here where we are hidden and safe."

"I have to go, and I am afraid."

"But if you go, if this ends, we will forget. There will be work and family, age and death and change. And then this-"

"Then this will seem like a dream half-remembered."

"We can hide from the sun. We can pull this grass around us."

"If I whisper to you that I love you..."

"It will be all that I can hear."

"And if I tangle with you in this secret field..."

"It will become ours and all that I need."

"And if I miss my train to stay here with you..."

"Then you will give up the world and joys of your own making for this moment and the promise of this night."

"You cannot promise me endless nights of green fields and caresses."

"And you will not stay to find out."

"I can stay until the dawn, but even now the light is changing."

"Kiss me, quickly."
## Music

MUSIC

"Joshua, turn that down. I can still hear it."

Her son shot her a look of pure, cold, hard death in the rearview mirror and thumbed at the device. He slouched even further in the seat and bobbed his head, looking out the car window with resumed, majestic apathy.

The volume may have decreased, but she couldn't tell. She could still hear the incessant thumping bassline and the scratchy angry lyrics that occasionally resolved into epithets.

She dug her nails into her palms around the steering wheel. The veins on the back of her hands writhed.

He had this thing lately where he would ride in the back like she was his driver. His gangly legs folded, just so, to dig his knees into her seat. When the chorus came in he would slap out the beat on his lap or drum his fingers against the glass.

What drove her up the wall, however, weren't his antics. She had done her reading on parenting, spoken with her elders and her experienced "mom" friends. She knew well enough that she and her son were powerless before tyrants: hormones and the quests for self-identity, for pussy, and possibly for penis. She'd found all his pornography long ago.

No, what was digging its hooks into her skin more than anything else was the simple fact that her son and child and flesh was abjectly tone deaf. The fact that he listened to snarling overpaid idiots encouraging him to rape and vice didn't bother her nearly as much as the fact that he couldn't keep pace with the rhythm and the rhyme scheme.

It was only through force of will that she kept from swerving the car into a curb, reaching back and snatching off his headphones to shriek in full fury,

"LISTEN! GOD DAMN IT... CAN'T YOU FUCKING LISTEN. IT'S NOT: uh UH UH these BITCHES ain't SHIT to me. THE EMPHASIS IS CLEAR AND PLAIN: uh UH uh THESE bitches ain't SHIT to me. IT IS NOT THAT HE WANTS YOU TO GET THE POINT THAT WOMEN ARE BITCHES, BUT THAT THESE FUCKING WOMEN IN FUCKING PARTICULAR ARE BITCHES. AND THERE'S A MELODY, A SIMPLE LITTLE MELODIC HOOK TO THE CHORUS. SIXTEEN NOTES. LIKE A GOD DAMNED NURSERY RHYME; WHY CAN'T YOU FOLLOW IT? WHY CAN'T YOU CARRY A TUNE? IT'S IN A MAJOR KEY FOR FUCK'S SAKE, IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. AT ALL. I WAS FIRST CLARINET FOR MY ENTIRE FOUR YEARS AT STATE. I WON CONTESTS - CONTESTS. I FUCKED YOUR FATHER IN THE ORCHESTRA PIT FOR 'CARMEN' IN PARIS AND I BLEW THE CONDUCTOR ON THE SIDE. I FUCKING HELPED HIM WITH HIS ARRANGEMENTS - REWROTE THE PART FOR VIOLA FOR THE ARIA MYSELF, AND THE WEDDING MARCH FOR THAT ASSHOLE'S SECOND MARRIAGE. AND WHY. THE FUCK. ARE YOU. MY. CHILD."
## Gravity

GRAVITY

Careening through dust and void
hurtling and spinning all wobbly specks,
mere specks, scattered like so much flour
onto surface before the dough is kneaded.
Per·func·to·ri·ly, out of habit

And in the rhythm of the the baker working the dough,
dashing out fingerfuls of flour onto wood worn smooth
before knuckling into the soft mass
leaning weight into it and rolling the shoulders
Dusted just like that

I watched the bread that would be crust form as though by magic.
Protein chains forming and tangling and setting into shape
to pass from one's hands into another
as something made and crafted according to a pattern
determined long ago.

"What are you staring at? Pay the man."

It was just pizza after all and
we shared it by the window bundled into winter clothes
with mittens removed and placed beside us,
our mittens touching as though we were still holding hands.

She knitted them as a matching set of four; his and hers, left and right.
We ate and the sleet came down
and the world was grey and spinning madly through the deep,
the bare and dusty unknowable deep.

Less than a blink - less and shorter than that -
I was there with her then and we ate
and the rock turned quickly beneath us;
tumbling, clinging to us as we cling to it.

That's gravity for you:
everything reaches out for everything else.
Stay and hold me.
That's gravity, right? Don't go away.
The sun does this. And the moon, and the dust.
Of course the bigger you are, the more you pull.
But everything pulls in some small way.

Please stay here close to me, right?
This thin little smear of life on the falling rock,
like grease on our fingers, thinner than even that.
And we cling to the earth and it clings to us.
It's gravity saying come closer, closer still,
all of you, gather around me and stay,
why are we so scattered apart and flying apart?

Please don't leave me alone.
Rain on the glass, neon in the window, clouds overhead
We eat together and the flesh works our little speck lives
a little further along, a little slower, a little older, a little less efficiently.
The errors accumulate, bones brittle a little more,
the brain fogs a little bit.

In 30 years, if we're lucky, we'll still be together,
aching and pained on raining, sleeting days like this.
Joints that long lost their elasticity will suffer the changing pressures
and it will ache for us to be out on miserable rainy days.
Winters will gnaw at us a little more intently.
There'll be love there, still,
mixed with simple familiarity
and the shared experience
and routine
of two people who decided to hold hands until this rock spins itself out;
routine slowly going erratic and slowing and wobbling
like tops spinning out their energy and starting to shudder,
skittering to a sudden, clattering stop;
finally, endlessly calm and still.

And as for the planet, in a little while yet, it too will be consumed by the Sun. It won't make any sense, but it won't matter either. Do you know how old Old will be by then? Yeah, sure, years from now, eons from now, supernova eventuality, but come on, nothing lasts forever. And so: gravity - gravity is something alone reaching for everything around itself saying, "Don't go, come here and stay with me until this is over." 60 years? 70, if you're lucky. Maybe 80, if you don't smoke. 90, if your genes are right - and even then the earth itself will die, eventually. Right out from under your feet.

The Sun pulls at those passing comets, each so bright and in a hurry, and the Earth pulls at the slowly receding Moon, and the Moon pulls at the Earth. And the trash in the gutter pulls at Mars and that new planet nobody knew about and still has trouble accepting, even that thing way out there, it's pulling at you too, and your mother misses you and wishes you'd call more often and she's pulling at you too, to come close and closer still and to stay. All the things you don't know about, will never learn about, and will never do or see in your life, those things are still pulling at you too, in all directions, just as you're pulling at everything in return. And all those letters you meant to write or never sent, they pull at you, and you pull at them. That's gravity. Gravity is that ache for connection made real, and that's just the way it works. It's not magic - I don't make this stuff up.

ANGEL

In the dream, I am lurching homewards through the city late at night, and I am stumbling drunk. It is not a real drunkenness, because in the way of dreams I am lucid and observing as though trapped in my unsteady body. I am unable to place my feet correctly, unable to force my eyes to keep focus. I know that I'm drunk, but I cannot remember how. The other night owls give me a wide berth and they turn to watch me sway along. I want to tell them that I'm sober, that I'm fine. But all that comes from my raw lips is garbled speech. I look disheveled. I must have thrown up because the taste is in my mouth and my shirt is soaked and stinking. I feel like a zombie.

I stagger into an alley and have to pause at a dumpster to retch onto the ground. I cannot make sense of what comes out. I don't remember dinner. In the mess, I can see pale, oddly blue specks that look like they might be undissolved pills. It is damp and chilly out but I am sweating with a fever. My throat is raw from stomach acid.

I look up to see a radiant figure, male, nude, hairless, and glowing magenta. His arms taper to neat amputations at the wrists. From where his eyes should be reach the hands of a child. The fingers are clasped across his face in a way that looks like a mask, but also reminds me of my grandmother, sitting on her fading couch, clasping her fingers in her lap while looking out the window. Looking away through windows when she spoke of my father, the soldier and the hero. Her hands touching each other lightly, fingers interlacing. She spoke in reverent tones, "He was such a good boy. My little man. You look just like him." This figure hovers a foot in the air with arms out like Jesus, and he waits for me to swallow my bile.

It is perfectly natural, serene even. That ruddy light burns away the stink and the drunkenness. I can stand up straight, though it makes me ache all over, and even that ache begins to fade the longer I look at him. The city fades away around us both, and he says to me, in strange choral tones, "You are besieged." The hands unfurl from each other, both pointing to me as clearly as any gaze. His breath brings more light, and it streams into me, entering my senses intimately. I nod and lick my cracked, raw lips.

"I think I am sick. Can you help me?" My voice trembles. He is beautiful and sincere, and I feel no need to resist. His hands come together touching his thumbs to his brow in a gesture of prayer. He bows his head.

"I am simply the message. Will you hear it?" Closer he drifts to me, leaning down to kiss, and those hands that are eyes reach for my face with tingling caresses. I open my lips to draw him in, and our teeth clash like sparks and embers. He is warm to the touch, and the embrace feels like a longing fulfilled, like prophecy on the eve of revelation, like coming home from a cruel sea.

I cannot find the words - and when it is over, he pulls away from me with one hand reaching down to cover his mouth, the other reaching up to clasp his bare brow in spread fingers. Those hands like eyes. My heart pounds; I ache for more of this strange connection, and I reach out and through him.

But he is already receding as a dream within a dream, tilting his head as though in pity. I am left alone in the alley, which even now becomes here, alone in my bed. I awake to sirens.

## Alice

ALICE

"Alice. Alice, wake up," he touched her shoulder, glancing across the car. It was raining, he needed both hands on the wheel. She woke up to the rippling blur of distant fields; water on the side window. Her breath spread and receded upon the glass. She had fallen asleep while they were still in the city and now, later, she saw dreamy green fields in the distance. Cold, gray spring rain. She sat up and ached in a dozen places. Her neck hurt and she winced, "Bleh."

"You should've let your seat back and just slept that way. Laying back." He had to watch the road, so Alice had the distinct perspective of observing him talk without being spoken to directly. His face was tense with worry and concentration. It was raining rather hard, and this stretch of road wasn't very well marked. He couldn't see her watching him, and so he continued, "I knew you were going to wake up sore, slumped over like that." She saw there was grey above his ear. He wrung his fingers on the wheel and kept checking the rearview mirror.

"I'm fine. Where are we?"

"I don't know. I need you to check the map. I think - I think we missed the exit a couple miles back, and I don't see any off-ramp; there's nowhere to turn around." He glanced at her and frowned at her groggy state. She wasn't with him in this moment, she was still waking up or something. He was the one driving and the one who knew how lost they could very well be.

"Are you okay?" He asked, and she heard in it the testy accusation. The implication that she wasn't okay, that somehow she was failing him. She was supposed to be the navigator and now they were lost. She heard his frustrated annoyance spilling onto her. He was embarassed and taking out on her.

"I'm fine. Let me find it."

"What? The map? It's right there, between your feet. You're stepping on it."

"I see it. I've got it." She rustled it open, a sprawling tangle on paper. It seemed entirely ridiculous and unwieldly. She turned it a couple times to get her bearings. She heard him sighing and the creak of his seatbelt. He was irritated, and now she was too.

"Okay, so where are we?" She asked, peering up the main lines, using her finger to trace over their route.

"I don't know. That's the thing, we missed the exit and I'm not sure how to get us back." The edge in his voice made her jaw tighten. She wanted out of the car, to walk and stretch and breathe the cool damp air.

"Well what do you want me to do? I was asleep. You missed the turn." The fight was inevitable and monstrous, clawed and already in the air, mid-pounce.

He rolled his shoulders and she could feel him winding up something sharp to say, something that would hurt. Guilt and doubt began to seep in around the edges; she was the navigator, after all. She did fall asleep, after all. And if she was tired, it kind of was her fault. They had sex last night. In a motel. It was awkward and protracted and he seemed such a little boy then, eager to please and getting nowhere. Perhaps she should've just faked something so they could've gotten to sleep. She couldn't remember the last time she really enjoyed their lovemaking. It had become a confessional and a series of reflexes; habit. And she could feel this now carving the air between them with claws out and fangs showing. She looked at him bristling within himself and wondered if he could sense it too, the inevitable stupidity. She wondered when she stopped loving him, and when she would admit it to him without meaning to, letting it slip by accident.

He glanced over to her again, about to speak. This is what they were going to fight about this time: being lost in the rain. And in the space between the flip and flap of the windshield wipers she saw two things with clarity: she saw his mouth forming the words, and through the crystal pane of the glass already blotting over with fresh drops, she saw the massive rolling wave of metal leaping across the divider. The 16-wheeler sailed through the air with an achingly beautiful grace, and the driver inside stared in stupid, unfocused shock. Completely out of control. There was no time for anything more; the surging tide of it blocked out the gray sky, sweeping everything away.
