GALACTUS AND THE LITTLE PRINCE

So one night, the Little Prince wakes up to find that Galactus is hovering just beyond the tiny sphere of his planet, looking famished.

"GALACTUS MUST FEED" says the grand force of nature, clad in aurora and magenta. His voice booms across the cosmos and snuffs out a dozen stars.

"Mais, ma planète est très petite," says the Little Prince quietly, tying his robe around himself. It is soft and cozy and he is still in his pajamas.

"THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I WILL CONSUME ALL BEFORE ME AND I WILL NOT BE DENIED." Galactus turns his gaze down upon the surface of the small planet and squints his eyes; for it is very small indeed and the Little Prince himself is but a boy.

"Mais monsieur, ma fleur mourra. Je l'aime."

"I AM THE EATER OF WORLDS." They had reached an impasse.

"Ma planète est trop salée et vous n'aimerez pas le goût," proclaims the Little Prince, honestly. He goes to his kitchen for a large spoon and scoops up a heaping of dirt. He offers it to Galactus who looks at him for a long, long time before accepting the sample.

"THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND I AM ETERNAL. IN TIME, I WILL DEVOUR ALL WORLDS. IN TIME, YOURS TOO WILL JOIN ETERNITY IN MY BEING - BUT NOT TODAY. IN TIME, YOU WILL GROW OLD AND DIE. AND IN TIME, YOUR FLOWER WILL WITHER AND DIE WITH YOU. WHEN I RETURN, YOU BOTH WILL HAVE PASSED INTO DUST. I WILL THEN FEED UPON THIS SMALL WORLD AND I WILL THINK OF YOU."

Then the great being Walked Away. He shook terribly with hunger and ground his great teeth, spraying a dozen comets into the void. The Little Prince watched him go. He watered the rose that he loved so dearly and promised to be faithful, and then he shuffled back to bed. He dreamed - not just that night, but thereafter into his old age - of shooting stars and the broad, spanning footprints of gods.
