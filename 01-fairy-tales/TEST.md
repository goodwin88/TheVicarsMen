Once, in a village at the edge of a long and blue wood, there lived a maiden who kept secrets as one keeps small bright stones. She tended a small garden, mended nets, and sometimes left offerings of bread and wild thyme at the roots of the oldest oak.

The wolf watched from the dark where the trees kept their counsel. He was a patient animal and a careful listener. When the maiden left a door ajar, the wolf came close enough to hear the hush of the house and the quiet counting of her stitches.

They made an exchange one autumn evening: the maiden gave a piece of her bread and a single word she had never spoken aloud; the wolf gave back a soft tooth and a promise that he would keep the night watch. What followed was not what the villagers expected, nor was it what the forests promised; it was, instead, something small and true.
