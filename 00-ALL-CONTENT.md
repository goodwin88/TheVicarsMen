## The maiden and the wolf

THE MAIDEN AND THE WOLF

1

"Your birthday will be soon, in a few days time - aren't you excited?"

"Yes, Mama," she said blushing, scratching behind her ear. She snapped green beans into her bowl. The two them in their chairs with broad bowls in their laps, chairs her father had made with his own hands. He was away fishing. She knew he had taken the long way to the creek. As he passed neighboring homes, he would invite all he met to come for her birthday. Such celebrations were hardly secret and she squirmed in her seat, tapping her feet in happy anticipation.

Her mother glanced over, "I can see that, and you know we're going to be busy around here getting things ready. It would be a good time for you to finally visit your grandmother, and to stay with her until then."

The young girl paused in surprise. Her mother nodded, watching her own nimble fingers. "You're a young woman now; you can travel the woods alone. Besides, she would want to see you before your big day and she won't be able to make the trip here herself. It would be best for you go." She said this last with a tone of finality.

"Your brother will manage your chores."

She packed a napkin with bits of hard food and folded it into her sleeves. She took her father's walking stick and her mother's greatcloak. Her brother gave her his small collection of found flint arrowheads. She ruffled his tangled hair and kissed them all before leaving. Her mother pressed a folded letter into her hand, "Give this to her when you arrive. Stop for nothing." She held her gaze and peered into her daughter's open young face, fixing the image to memory.

Her father then braced her shoulders and smiled behind his shaggy moustache. He said, "We'll see you soon, my love. You'll come back a foot taller, I know it." His eyes twinkled. "Stay to the path."

Her brother tugged at her sleeve and hugged her. "Please, hurry back. Mama said we can't have any of the cakes until you do." She whispered to him, "I'll share mine with you for doing my work."

Her family stood apart from her and waved. She looked back once before leaving the dusty yard at the edge of the forest. Her family stood small against a small house. A goat, some hens, an ax in the stump and a neat pile of split wood. A garden. Gathering the thick tatters about her, she entered the wooded briars.

And was immediately swallowed up by the gloom. Above, the rustling canopy blocked out the sun. All around her, the gnarled trunks crowded so that she saw nothing but shifting, mossy gray bark. Small creatures darted ahead of her. Shapeless birds brushed by her ears. She pulled up her hood and kept her eyes to the path. It wasn't much of one, overgrown and patchy. She would follow the bare trail for a few paces and then look around to see where it picked up again. A few times she felt as though she had strayed, but then beyond the next rotting log she would find the thread again.

As she picked her way through the brambles, her long cloak kept catching on thorns until she finally tore the low hem away into strips. She tied these around her hands and fingers to protect them. Still she bled from a hundred scratches. But she was away from home for the first time and so this was unimportant. She slipped on slick leaves and into sinkholes until she learned to use the walking stick to feel her way along.

Night came to the woods before the sun had set and she considered stopping to rest. Her feet hurt, her legs ached, her knuckles stung with sweat and scars. Nearby was a stone under a sprawling oak. She was exhausted, and there she could sit and eat. As soon as she thought this, it was impossible to consider otherwise. Making her way to the boulder, she pulled out her napkin and leaned against the large stone, aching and sore. She had no idea how far she had come, nor how far she had left to go. When with her parents, the trip to visit her Grandmother was a pleasant day's journey. She recalled a broad well-worn path through these same woods. She recalled the view from her father's shoulders when he sometimes carried her. It was a sunny place then; full of flashing cardinals and butterflies and berries by the wayside.

Nothing like this. At least she wouldn't starve, she thought, unfolding the cloth. Yet, no sooner had she done so than two great shadows swooped down and startled her. It was a pair of crows. They squawked, pilfering the hunk of cheese and the black bread she had so carefully packed. Before she knew it, up they flapped with her meal. But they didn't leave, instead they circled above her taunting and cackling.

Quick as a flash, she felt for her pouch and selected the largest sharp stone. She took aim and flung it, striking a crow out of the air. It dropped the bread it carried, and the two birds then rose higher, away into the treetops. They cawed and screeched, "We'll be back fore yer bones, whelp!" She grinned and ran to where the bread had fallen. She crouched there in the underbrush and ate, hidden, ravenous, but wary now of any eyes from above.

She gnawed at the quarter-loaf and watched for the returning crows. But she was so busy with this, that she didn't see a figure approach from below until it was upon her. It was large and blotted out a massive shadow against dim dappled moonlight. How had such a thing crept up so close?

"An impressive throw," it growled lowly, by way of introduction. She yelped and fell back, stumbling. She turned over and scrambled at first on all fours, then to her feet. She dashed back to the path, her cloak snagging and tearing all the way by brambles. It followed her. It was noisy. It crashed behind her and snapped branches to splinters. It thundered the earth at her heels. She reached the bare little line of dirt that marked the path, and it seemed even more dubious in the dark like this. It was less like a path than a chance gap between thorn bushes.

The dark beast drew up short and reared over her. It was now close enough for her to smell its dank earthy scent, rich as turned loam. She caught sight of millipedes and gleaming black beetles seething among its bristles. Moss hung from its craggy haunches and rolling shoulders, each broad as bulls. It was the Wolf. He narrowed his yellow eyes and grinned at her gasp of recognition.

"Yes, you know me. I've seen you before, here along the path holding your father's hand." He crouched before her and dug his claws into the dirt and rotting leaves, stretching. He cleaved great furrows into the forest floor. She saw hanging from his mouth was her walking stick, small as a toothpick in its maw. He plucked it from his muzzle and placed it at her feet, "And I've heard what he's told you about me."

"To stay on the path, or the Wolf...y-you...would eat me." She shuddered but stared back. Bending, she retrieved the staff and held it with both hands. The worn wood was still hot from his breath. She shivered as she curled her fingers around where his lips had been.

He rose and prowled around her, placing his heavy paws and stepping over the path with care not to touch it. Moving, the beast shed vermin off its hide like overripe fruit. Rank fetid breath curled into the air in hot moist blasts. He was steaming all over. He brushed against the thick ancient trees and the thick trunks groaned and creaked. The broad trees yielded as though flimsy green saplings. He nodded a head as large as a wagon, and ground his terrible teeth, "And I still may. This path is a courtesy I extend to your kind."

"You lie," she exclaimed, "My father told me that you are forbidden to touch the path and those upon it." She pulled deeper into her cloak and coughed, gagging on his scent of rich woody decay. Weeds and wildflowers bloomed along the soil of his flanks, then consumed by a thousand caterpillars. The great Wolf circled her like this once before waggling his rump to make room and sitting down beside her. He came down with a loud boom and flatted small trees beneath him. He crossed his heavy forepaws and lowered his head to examine her. Leaves drifted around them like falling ashes. The forest grew quiet, holding its breath.

"Your father is a good man, and I see that he cares for you to tell you such things. It is comforting for a child to think this, but the way of the world is not the way of your small yard and smaller home. And this feeble scratch in the dirt that you follow is no haven; it won't protect you from what lives in these woods."

"I was fine until I left it for the comfort of that rock beneath the oak. I was going to rest there and eat, but no sooner had I stepped off the path than those crows attacked me."

"I saw all that - most amusing. 'Fine' you say? Oh no, my dear. You've had hungry admirers ever since you first set foot in these woods. But, I persuaded them to leave you be. You see, it is not the path that protects you here: I do," he lowered his eyes.

"But you're monstrous!" She exclaimed and he chuckled, growling into a shaking laughter. He rolled onto his side and thumped his giant tail, pounding the earth. The trees trembled, dropping leaves and dust and rats and snakes. Old limbs finally snapped, tumbling to the ground. It seemed as if the floor itself would split open and swallow them all as he cackled. His booming laugh rattled her bones.

"How reasonable you make that sound," he said, finally calming and licking foam from his chops. His mouth was a cave of endless stony teeth.

The girl looked back down the path and then around her. She scanned the darkness for other threats, predators and the like. But she had seen nothing all day beside startled small creatures.

"I don't believe you. I don't believe you, and you are keeping me from my journey. Goodbye," She hoped that sounded unafraid and serious. She tried to sound like her mother but she was grateful the cloak hid her quivering. She set out, her stick before her, feeling the way.

The Wolf sprawled onto his back and bared his throat, belly, and loins. Moths and fireflies swarmed through the rising mist off his body.

He called after her, "Are you going home, then?"

She stopped and looked around, it did seem familiar, but it was so hard to tell now. She scowled and returned, passing him without a glance. She walked in the other direction. The wolf sprawled on his back and grunted as she stomped by. His pawed at himself and scratched burrowing moles from his belly.

He called after her, "That way's no good either, this isn't the same path you know. You've left it and now all ways look the same."

"If you aren't going to eat me, leave me alone. You frighten me and now that I am lost that is a distraction I cannot afford."

Behind her the wolf crumbled into a grassy pile as if he had never been, soft mushrooms already forming around the edges. He roused himself from the earth next to her as if, beneath the rotting leaves, he had been there all along. He shook himself free of debris and flung worms from his ears.

"I eat everyone eventually."

But she seemed to amuse him and he accompanied her through the woods the rest of that night. She did not want this at first, and ignored him, keeping her fear to herself and her eyes on the increasingly useless path. It forked as it had not done before.

"Where does that way lead?" She asked.

He shrugged, "Where are you going?"

She had not said and so he did not know. She learned two things: he was not a god and she now had a secret.

"Can't you see beyond this forest?"

"There is no world beyond this forest."

"But you've seen my family before, and other travellers?"

"Yes."

"If we pass through this forest of yours; where do you think we come from, and where do you think we go?"

"You avoid my question."

"So do you."

And he was a wolf then, perhaps as large as an ox and muddy about the paws, but a wolf just the same, and simply so. She was not afraid of him and he was no longer fearful. As she watched, he flinched and scratched at parasites. There were scars about his body and he looked hungry. The trees were blocking sunlight again, not the weak moonlight from before. And then saw that he made a rather pathetic figure. Recalling his initial presence, she wondered if it had been a dream.

"We should go this way."

They travelled in awkward silence. He avoided the path still, but kept pace with her. He would stop, alert to something she couldn't see and sniffing the air. Then he would dart off straight as an arrow out of sight. She heard growling and savagery that frightened her. Each time he returned, panting and slackjawed, a little more torn about the ears. He once grinned to her with bloody fangs, and said in a weary growl, "It was nothing, let us continue."

At intersections and forks in the path, they took turns selecting which way to go. If he knew the way, he did not say it. He respected her intuition each time, and never questioned her decisions. He didn't again ask her where she was going. She didn't ask him how he became so small. They travelled together for many miles that day.

In the end, he was about the size of a large dog. When he ran ahead to confront these things only he could see, he stayed away longer and longer each time. He came back looking more and more ragged. It was her decision to stop for the night when she worried he might not survive another encounter.

They made to rest where the way split again. She had never again left the path and intended to camp on the road itself. He caught a rabbit and devoured it close to her. She ate berries she had picked along the way. She watched him scratch and lick his wounds, her own itching in sympathy. He did not want her berries, and she did not want want his caught game. With a sharp stone and some care she plucked the ticks from his hide and used a stick to clean his ears. She spread her cloak on piled leaves and they slept soundly together, exhausted.

In the morning he was gone. She woke to the rustling of feathers and sat up to see two crows on the ground staring at her. One had dried and matted blood on its face.

"Rawk! Pretty thing you are," screeched one.

"We said we'd be back fer your bones," cried the other.

They shuffled closer, hop-stepping as birds do, with menace in their voices. She saw that one held a dagger. They meant to intimidate her, snapping their beaks in the air. She rose, bare, her walking stick lay out of reach, her flints as well. She curled her fingers into fists; these were bullies, but she was older now. She had her own scars and her family to think of.

"I chased you off before, you are both fools for returning." They circled her, sizing her up.

"That wasn't you, we left because of him. And now he's gone because of us," said one.

"Though you helped weaken him," cawed the other. They both cackled at this. She lunged for the one with no blade, the one she had wounded before. It squawked in surprise and leapt for the air, but she had her fingers in its feathers now. She pulled it to the ground with a strength she had not known she possessed. The birds had puffed up their feathers to seem larger, but were quite frail. Under her rage thin avian bones snapped and the bird complained in agonized surprise. She put her knees to its chest and hooked her fingers inside its beak. She pried it wide as if to tear the spread face open completely. It squealed and thrashed about, bucking and slapping its wings. Her strength came and she felt the jaw giving way.

"Drop your knife or you're next," she bellowed over the bird's struggle.

The other crow did so, aghast.

"Stop it, yer killin' him!"

She hissed spittle through her teeth and held her grip, pinning the bird beneath her. It started to choke, eyes rolling up into its skull.

"Where is he? What have you done with him?"

The standing bird blinked and worked its beak, flustered and hopping from foot to foot. It hunched over and pointed to a fallen log nearby.

"There! We lef' him there - he's not dead! We were just gon' to scare you 's all. We couldn't kill him if we wanted tew.. Rawk! Get off'm! You've ruined 'im for certain, poor chicky!" The bird flailed its wings in the air, circling and diving around them. The indicated log was close, but off the path. She released the bird beneath her and stood up. Its partner landed and fretted over the mangled body.

She gleamed with sweat, layered with dust and feathers. Her pulse raced with purpose. Without hesitation she fetched up the stick her father had given her. Scooping up the crows under her arms, she plucked out their pinions and tail feathers. She tore a strip from her cloak and tied the large feathers to one end in a bunch as a broom. She took the fallen dagger.

And then she swept out her own path to the log. She cleared the leaves and stones away, and she cut back the brambles. As she went along, the treetops parted and sunlight flooded in through the canopy. There, beyond the rotting timber lay the wolf, bloody and scratched. He was more flayed than whole and already drawing flies. He was not dead, but his wounds were severe. Both eyes were pecked out. The crows could not have done this all themselves. She was looking around for an answer when he spasmed, coughing out blood.

"Is that you? Are you safe? There was another beast. I fought it back, but it left me so weak. The birds ambushed me..."

"Yes, I'm here," she knelt at his side and pulled his head to her lap.

"You are off the path," he whispered.

"I make the path," she replied and he chuckled, wincing and gurgling.

"How reasonable you make that sound." He grew still, then became as the soil in her arms. When she was younger, she and her brother would follow her father behind the plow. They would inspect the freshly turned earth for treasure. They trod the rows as two giants crossing leagues, whole mountains with each step.

She returned to the main path and the two pitiful crows. The one held the other and looked up at her with wet swollen eyes, "We were just hungry and yew had food. We were cowards with a knife."

She pulled her things together and drew her mother's cloak around her shoulders. Gently now, she took the birds into her arms.

"I am going to my Grandmother's. I know now that it's not far from here. We will find food and rest there and I will care for you both until you can fly again. Our account will be settled. This knife," she said, "is now mine."

She emerged from the forest bearing her broom and her charges, her cloak ragged and torn. In the clearing was a hut, small and shaded beneath an oak. Her grandmother was waiting for her in the doorway, a cat by her ankles. The older woman ambled out to meet her and smiled. She took the birds and tended to them, nodding approval. She took the cloak and showed her how to mend it. She took the broom with an amused laugh and showed her how to fashion one properly. She fed her and listened to her story. She told her her own. In it, there was a wolf as well, grand and powerful and green.

She stayed until the crows were well. It could have been days, it might have been months. But when she finally decided to go home, it was to visit and not to stay. Her brother was older; he was behind the plow now. Her parents were streaked with grey. They finally had their celebration, and her birthday feast was long remembered by those who came. She pulled her mother aside and handed her a letter from her grandmother, written in response to her own sent so long ago. The two women read it together and talked in private as close and knowing friends.

## The mark of true love

THE MARK OF TRUE LOVE

There was once a young couple, engaged and soon to be wed. Both were from the same small village, his house next to hers. Both shared the same circle of friends and the same few enemies. They were happy, and together they were strong.

But they weren't always together. And once, while he was away hunting, there came a terrible, sudden storm. She worried for him and went next door to his father and mother to await his return. Together, they lit candles and set them in the windows against the gloomy night.

The downpour had caught him by surprise, and so he took shelter in a cave. Soaked, miserable, and feverish, he crawled inside and found a deep, dank cavern. In the center of this rough chamber dwelled a crooked little witch in a hovel of bat shit and gathered bones.

Though the cave was cold and damp, the witch kept no hearth. And though he was hungry, she had no food. But she did offer him company and bade him to visit with her through the storm. He did so and they passed the night in sport and conversation. They wrestled and spit and shared crude humor. He forgot his fever and his loneliness away from home. But as the night grew long he could not sleep, worried about his love.

All this time, several small glowing frogs had been following the witch about and provided an eerie, curious light. The witch crushed one in her fist and painted his forehead with it. "Now you will dream of your true love," she said, "Your true love will receive you and know that you are here and well."

However, in his sleep he dreamed not of his betrothed, but of another. And in his dream they loved as though their love was well-worn and familiar.

He awoke the next day, outside the cave where there was now no cave at all. The sky was sunny and clear. He only vaguely remembered his dream and it troubled him at first, but then he put it out of his thoughts. It was all fever dream, and it had passed with the night.

Returning home, his love and his family were there in the doorway still waiting and worried. Seeing him at a distance, they cheered and made merry. However, she could wait no longer and raced to meet him halfway. They laughed and blew kisses until she was almost in his arms. Then she stopped, and she pointed to his face. Her face slack with surprise and dismay.

"What is that on your brow? Why is that written upon your skin?"

He touched his face and felt the mark still there.

"It was for you, my love. So you would not worry. And here I have returned, see? There is no cause for alarm - I will wipe it off like so."

But it did not wipe away. And she fled from him, crying. At his home, his family turned their faces from the mark, and his father pointed without looking.

"Go and wash your face by the river," the old man said, sternly and without looking.

Though confused, he did so. He knelt at the river to see his reflection. But the water's surface recoiled and churned in disgust; the reeds rustled from the shallows and whispered in the wind.

"Liar," they wailed.

He drew his hunting knife and held up the keen blade. It was a gift from her, and he kept it well. He looked into the mirror it made and sought to read the mark upon his face.

But no sooner did he level his gaze than the once polished metal rusted over completely.

"Liar," it hissed.

He fell to his knees, his face burning, the mark hot and searing. He scratched at the maddening itch forming there above his eyes. He howled and pulled at his flesh. Taking up the ruined blade, he drew it along his jaw and up and around. He was a skilled and practiced hunter, but the skin came away messily, ragged. The face as he finally saw it, through the tears and the blood, was strangely his own, well-worn and familiar.

## The three foolish wishes

The Three Foolish Wishes


    When it's only the two of us,
    it is not always clear who is right
    and who is wrong.

    Only that for one to push
    the other must pull,
    like those great saws
    that can wail like violins
    when played just right.

    We take turns at the hammer
    to build our traps.

    And this too is a kind of partnership.

Once, hidden in the woods,
a woodcutter took to his daily work
with his axe and his usual eye for destruction.

It led him to an old fine tree
that contained a nymph
who was sleeping unawares,
but, oh, how she shrieked
at the first shaking blow.

She begged and she pleaded

"Please, stop!
In all this thick forest
you choose me to dismember,
Wait, hold your stroke!
Can you not hear me? No more!"

The woodcutter heard her cries,
but he was one to finish
what he had begun
and to ruin
what he had wounded.

The nymph was desperate.

"I'll grant you three wishes,
anything you want.
But you won't find them here, out in the world.
You must return to your home to claim your prize."

However this was a man whose daily urge
drove him outside to violence.
What welcoming home fosters that?

He didn't particularly believe the nymph,
but was moved.

His wife met him at the door, and they resumed
where they had left off, with the bickering
and the sniping,
and the chipping away,
and the felling of their own dead, wooden love.

She was better at it than he was, like a hatchet on fire.

"Where have you been? How can you return here empty handed?"

He told her the truth and she was not impressed.

"I have slaved,
and I have sweated,
and I have martyred myself over this hot stove marriage,
trapped here while you frolic with nymphs,
and bring home lies and failure.

I suffer this union for you - don't you forget that.
Each day I am abandoned."

She cut away at him with surgical skill.
She knew when to find the better striking angle
that would leave him upright, held by a few splinters.

He was no nymph,
and he had no wishes to offer.

So he hid away in the woods with his little axe
and in sleep each night
with his soul hewn
and hollowed by her blade.

Dinners were daily, calculated tragedies;
cooked-up proof of her selfless devotion
and his own meager abilities to provide.

Her thin soups left him hungry,
yet he generally knew not to complain.
Grateful for anything wet and lukewarm.

"I wish there was a sausage for this soup," he muttered.

She was about to agree, in a way that would twist the knife most intimately
when suddenly a beefy link
dropped into his bowl.

Well now,
if that didn't shut her up for three seconds.

But then, oh, how she dug into him.
She spit into her hands and rubbed them together,
took up the haft and swung madly.

For if the first wish came true, then the rest were waiting.

"How could you waste a wish like that?
Of all the things I need around here-"

She complained vigorously,
But he was untouchable and serene.

He stared at her puffy red face
and working mouth.

Across the table, she looked miles distant.

"I wish this sausage was on the end of your nose."

It was ridiculous and instant.
She squealed in distress,
while he revelled in petty vengeance.

Because she was right,
she was always right;
he was wasting his wishes.

He could have wished for peace between them.
He could have wished for old love resurgent.
He could have wished for children,
for some kind of renewal,
or a simple and painless divorce.

But it was now too late
to be so mature.

The third wish came and went,
undoing all this mischief,
and they were back where they started,
staring in silence across the uncomfortable spread
of their cooling meal.

And yes, it was funny.
And yes, she got what was coming to her,
more or less.

But the memory of what could have been
that each kept privately
would return later in the dark,
in bed, back to back,

or while he exhausted himself at the axe,
pulling down the world - one tree at a time,

or while she cried without knowing why,
sweeping the ashes from the hearth.

## The ugly man

The Ugly Man

PART 1

Once upon a time, in a small but happy kingdom, a sweet and rosy-cheeked girl was born as Princess to the King and Queen of that land. While the Queen was still heavy wth child, the village seer paid a visit to the royal couple and, for the fee of a two buttons, laid hands on her belly to read the child’s fate. It was proclaimed that the babe would be blessed: she would know nothing of the ugliness in the world and would never have cause to cry. Pleased at this prophesy, the King declared that her birth would mark the day as a grand holiday to celebrate beauty and splendor.

When the day finally arrived, however, the sweet apprehension yielded mixed reward. For while the babe was as precious as foretold, as plump and as vibrant, she bore the strangeness of having no eyes. She was not merely blind; her face was smooth from her cheeks to her brow. In all other ways, however, she was perfect and delightful. She was born smiling, and throughout her youth laughter was never far from her lips. That she was blind never troubled her and though she was the daughter of the King and Queen all those who saw her felt moved to look after her as if she were their own. With age, she grew blessed with charm and grace, soft speaking and a delicate manner.

Each year, as the day of her birth came around, the holiday in her honor became a celebration that spun much revelry. And as she grew and blossomed, so did this carnival. By the time the blessed girl was obliged to wear the painted mark of her ripeness upon her smooth and untroubled brow, the day of joy had become a week-long festival. Yearly, pilgrims from nearby villages arrived in gaily costumed masses. Parades were held in a healthy spirit of competition to see which local troupe could outdo the others for the lavishness of their dress, the spirit of their piping, or the zest of their dance.

As always, the Princess was at the center of it all. It was she who decided the champions of the festival, a coveted reward that brought much honor to the village represented. With this in mind, costumes were designed not to please the eye but moreso the skin, so that she might touch them and find favor in their construction. Gold thread and fancy purples gave way to velvets and burlaps. One year the winning troupe paraded in elaborate vestments of raw wool and birchbark, winning out over fine silks and snakeskins. Gemstones were moot, for black pearls and paste baubles held equal regard.

And so, once a year, often the valuable became worthless and the worthless became prized beyond measure. Smooth gleaming gold gave way to precious rough rust. Brilliant scarves dipped in glitter yielded to cloaks of dried and crackling leaves. And puffed dandelions held dominion over all the fine crimson in the world.

In the same village of the King, Queen and their darling blind angel, lived a poor dirt farmer and his wife. Unlike the royals who had been without child for so long and later rejoyced in their strange and wonderful daughter, the farmer was beset on all sides by his brood. With more mouths to feed than hands to feed them with he was dismayed to learn that his wife was expecting, yet again. Each day as she grew more and more swollen with their fresh burden, the two counted heads at supper and wrung their hands with worry. Their hovel was collapsing, their children were sickly; they were as poor and wretched as could be and the lean market for dirt was thinning.

It came to pass that the farmer’s wife and the King’s Queen fell to labor at the same hour on the same day, each sweating and clawing into their bedsheets. Yet while the court doctor was present to ease the introduction of the Princess, none but the village midwife attended the poor family; with sleeves rolled up, squatting between red thighs. Amid the cries of the other infants and the yowling of mangy dogs circling the house, the old crone eventually wrestled out the newborn.

“My god, you have spawned a beast!” she exclaimed, and dropped the wriggling wet lump in horror. And it was true, for as they gathered around - the dirty-faced siblings, the exhausted and delirious mother and the farmer - they could see plainly that what lay squirming on the dusty floor, licked clean by their dogs, was less like an infant than a foul, brutish whelp.

It was lumpy, gnarled and covered with hair thick as fur. The thing twisted its limbs into the air and freed a horrible shrieking wail, pathetic and terrifying at the same time. It had swollen red eyes and many soft teeth. It rocked and arched and thrashed about under wet canine noses and curious licks. Its cries gained strength, broken by sputtered fits of choking.

“Take it away!” begged the farmer, panicked and desperate. For the fee of two buttons, the midwife scooped up the wet thing. She dropped the abomination into a sack and promised to dispose of it. Then the burly crone slipped away into the night, leaving the farmer to tend to his sobbing children and his broken and feverish wife.

It may not suprise you to learn that the seer and the midwife were one and the same; a clever witch, powerful in her way but not supremely so. When in need she called upon those more powerful to assist her, and those she appealed to would only help at great cost. In particular, the Witch owed a favor to the great beast of the Forest; an ancient, magical boar. The sow had once been human herself, long ago beyond memory when she was witch as well. Whether she changed into a beast to hide from her debts or whether the transformation was perhaps a price extracted could not be known, but she lived on to become the terror of the land. She never left the sprawling Forest, and those that strayed too deeply into its gloom would perish, devoured.

The Witch that was both Seer and Midwife owed this beast a debt that she intended to fulfill with the horrid babe now in her possession.

“Bring me a human child, and I will let you live to use what I’ve taught you,” the Boar had then cackled, grinding her hoof onto the crone’s chest, and marking her with the wound.

For her life, the Witch swore that she would deliver and the time had now come.

Pickng her way through the woods, with the babe in the sack on her back, she waited for the sow to reveal herself. She felt the eyes already upon her and knew the beast was there in the shadows, watching.

“I have come with your morsel, O Great Boar, O Sow of Sorrow,” she paused, panting, feeling her age in the ache of her bones, “I am here to pay what is due!”

“Where is my fee, wily hag?” Came the reply, “And play no tricks for I shall delight in trampling your flesh to jelly!” The boar shudderd hungrily, shaking the trees. It moved closer, quaking the ground with each step. There stood the Sow; large as a hill, covered with sod and boulders, with great curving stone tusks and eyes like hollow stumps brimming with foul water. The boar snorted proudly, her warm breath dank and sulfurous. It circled the Witch and snuffled at the sack impatiently.

“How delicious it smells, give it to me quickly before I gnaw off your thumbs.”

The Witch emptied the bag and cowered. Out tumbled the ugly babe into the muck of the Forest floor. It’s face was red and wet with tears. It cried blindly, soiled and miserable, cold and bruised. The Sow stepped back in surprise. The Witch feared for her life.

“What is this? This is no child!” She bellowed angrily. She grunted and snorted. At the flow of her hot breath the babe quieted, warmed for the first time in its short life. The Sow knelt and nudged about with her broad snout, smudging clay onto the child, marking it even as she sought to learn its nature.

“This is no child, it is some trick,” repeated the boar, more gently, forgetting the Witch and their bargain, forgetting her own hunger. “Some sad and ugly trick.”

Finding herself still intact, the Witch recovered her wits; presented with the strange sight of the Sow of Sorrows nestled into the mud and fawning like a nursemaid. She knew not what change had come over the Sow and she cared even less. She scrambled to her feet.

“Are we square?” the Witch asked, rolling her shoulders and standing straight. She fought to keep her voice level, to face the Sow as now an equal.

The boar looked up from her dotage with a deep rumble that shook the trees,

“We are square, Joga. Please leave us.” She then nosed the babe against her mossy side to suckle from honeyed teats. The Great Boar cooed with a dreamy melancholy; lost in nostalgia.

PART II

By the window they sat so that the sun fell warmly on them both. The Queen sat with her ever-smiling daughter as any mother would, and with wet happy eyes she placed the ripe mark upon that young, untroubled brow. The years had been kind to them all: the kingdom prospered, peace reigned, and though she and her husband were not futher blessed with children, their sole daughter filled every corner of their lives with joy. Blind she was, but keen of perception and of such optimism that she often saw the good in things unnoticed by others. And so she was beautiful.

Today was the start of her festival; down in the village the pennants were already flying high. There would be dancing in the streets and gifts exchanged, poetry and music to fill the air. The Princess, not yet a score in years, twittered eagerly.

“Be still, dear, or I shall ruin it.” The Queen finished quickly for the mark was simple, but still she held the girl’s face and studied it with a mix of emotions.

“Hurry mother, I can already hear the bands practicing in the fields. Are you almost finished?” She grinned, her rosy face upturned, her hands in her lap, endlessly touching and toying with all they could (her gown was festooned with ribbons and bits of string).

The Queen leaned close to kiss her.

“Yes, quite done. It is my duty to place it first, but I suppose I will have to teach you how to do it yourself.” The girl sprang to her feet and they embraced.

“Later, if you please. I don’t want to miss a thing.” She turned to the open window as if she could see through it.

“Come, Moriam let us go and fly our fingers.” Addressed, the Princess’ handmaiden and closest friend took the clever hand into her own and together they skipped out into the village. Guards followed at a respectable distance, under royal instruction to chaperone without detection. The Princess of course always knew of this but she never wanted to cause trouble for the guardsmen, nor give her parents reason to worry.

Today was different however. The Princess wanted to frolic a little more freely; she was a young woman now! She felt even moreso with the weight of the mark upon her, though it really was quite small. Arm in arm, Moriam led them through the forming crowds, describing the sights, particularly any boys. The Princess walked with her free hand outstretched, just letting her fingers trail over whatever they may. Being cooped in the castle for much of her life, she learned to savor these excursions and would often stop to feel the horns of a tethered goat or fresh laundry hung up to dry.

The girls turned into the Market where there was always something interesting to touch. The festival brought exotic goods as well as people and so they lingered over mounds of pineapple and giggled at green bananas.

They paused before a firebreather and the Princess had Moriam give him a coin for his most dazzling displays. He went to work, spitting his flames near the their heads so she could feel and smell it. A crowd gathered. The performer moved among them for tips and offerings and he was mobbed by good cheer and tossed coins. Moriam drew a sign into her palm with her finger when she saw that the guards were distracted. The girls ducked low and stumbled down an alley.

The village was one thing, old and familiar, but the yearly gathering of so many outsiders meant that around this core formed a shifting and ephemeral layer of tents and wagons. They could not get truly lost because the Castle was always in sight, however the local maze soon swallowed them up, confounding the gaurds' attempts to regain their quarry. The girls thrilled at this escape and they wandered through the outskirt tent city, marvelling at arriving caravans, and drifting further and further from the village itself. The Princess overheard stray remarks about her face and she instructed Moriam to purchase a veil. The vendor was a kindly old matron who sold them a soft simple veil for the price of two buttons and then invited the girls into her tent with an offer to paint their faces. Moriam hesitated, but the Princess was delighted by this and soon both were transformed, almost unrecognizable. Moriam had peacock feathers painted in paisley swirls along her arms and face, while the Princess was decorated in butterflies, the largest done in such a way that it she appeared to have beautiful yellow eyes behind her veil.

They passed the day enjoying the carnival and each other’s company, and their dizzy fun was made even more sweet by its illicit nature. Day soon slipped into night, naturally unnoticed by the Princess, but by Moriam as well who had succumbed to both wine and the charms of a masked harlequin youth. In fact, both girls had found beaus of high spirit by the time torches were lit. It was then that the first night of the festival took its true shape in the streets: dancing and music was everywhere, ever-changing, ever-spinning. They held hands, paired as paper dolls, and together the two maids tumbled through the arms of many fantastic admirers. Eventually, Moriam found herself as purpled plumage to a lithe man garbed as a crow, and the Princess spun through gypsy tents, blind and giddy at the hand of a fancifully scruffy burlap orangutang. Through the call and response of their laughter they remained connected and shared in all things that evening, oblivious to the hour and the frantic cries of desperate guardsmen.

By the dead of night these merry four - crow, ape, handmaiden and ripe, blind, blessed child - collapsed entangled before a crackling bonfire. The blaze was one of many lit around the rim of the tent village. The usual shape of the village was this: at its heart loomed tall the spires of the castle and court, then the grand moat, spanned by a series of draw bridges on islands. Along the edge of this moat thrived the village, and beyond that a vast span of field between it and the surrounding Forest. This ringed clearing was farmed for the most part but it also served as a buffer against the woods; dark, thick woods that were terrorized by the Boar and other unknown dangers.

However, now with the yearly swelling of its populace and the settlement of this ringed clearing by revelers and other pilgrims, the margin of safety against the Forest was narrow indeed. Visitors were warned to avoid the woods, and at night during the festivities, the occasional growl and crash would sound over the merrymaking. Sometimes eyes could be seen gleaming through the leaves. It was risky to linger and camp so close to the woods, but there was little room elsewhere and frankly such close danger made the revelry all the more delicious. The ring of bonfires marked the line of absolute safety, beyond which both the King and common sense had decreed wanderers would be taking their lives into their own hands.

It was into this woody night that Moriam occasionally glanced, seeing only the firelight reflected off damp crusty bark. Time and again, however, her attention fell back to the antics of her paramour. She took her turns at the passing flask.The Crow looped his arm around Moriam’s waist, his mask raised to his brow, his black feathers bronzed by the blaze which warmed them all.

“M’ladies fair,” he began, holding the clay jug of wine aloft, “On this first night of Festival, by the famed grace and strange beauty of the local princess, I, Lord Jollyrook McInkybeak of the Cozycrow clan do declare you two maids to be the finest examples of your fair sex, and proof of God’s good mercy upon this sorry world of men and madness he has wrought.”

“Hear, hear!” Roared the Orangutang, reaching for the bottle and drawing a deep swig of its contents. He sopped his face with the back of his rough red paw and leaned over to kiss the Princess on her cheek. For her part, she giggled and clapped at the toast.

“Bravo, dear bird! But tell me, what do you know of this princess, so strange as you say? My friend and I are newcomers to this event and have yet to see her, though we know it is held in her honor.”

Moriam reached over and squeezed her leg, and the Princess patted her hand, grinning impishly.

“I’m glad you asked, Lady Butterfly,” started the Crow, pulling down his mak and bending low, “For there’s nothing I enjoy more than to proclaim the virtues of-”

“Bugger that!” said the Orangutang, interruppting and swatting at the his friend,

“Don’t you listen to his squawkings, my pretties. This year is our first here as well. My cousin and I hail from upriver in the mountains beyond the Forest. We’re on our way to the southern port, to seek our fortunes upon the high seas. Stopping here along our way has been”, and here he nuzzled roughly at the Princess, “A rather fortunate decision made on the spur of the moment.

“It was my idea, truth be told,” said the Crow, flopping down beside Moriam and pushing his mask aside again to gain a kiss. She melted into his dark feathers, feeling them lightly brush a thousand such kisses against her bare arms.

Moriam closed her eyes and extended a lean leg, pressing her toes to her friend. She spoke to continue their game,

“Well, the Princess has been known to mingle in the village during these days. You boys may get your chance to meet her yet. I hear she travels with excellent company.”The Princess giggled. She slouched against the shaggy, ragged chest of base cloth and fingered at it idly, “Mmm, indeed you may. I’ve yet to see her myself, but I’ve heard that she never misses a festival.”

“We were told that she’s fair beyond all others,” spoke the ape, “though I can now see that there’s no accounting for taste.” He curled his arms around her from behind and pressed coarse lips against her neck. His beard scratched at her throat and the Princess turned her head aside, to bare herself even more. The man was rough and warm, every part of him crudely fashioned, textured and a joy to behold beneath her fingers. She yielded to his kisses and his embrace, his wide hands moving about her clothed body. She settled her palms to them, holding them fast for a moment,

“I may have heard somewhere that she’s a monster.”

At this both men startled, then looked to each other and laughed roundly.

“Oh aye, my lady, without a doubt she must be,” remarked one with a wink. The other added,

“And with envious green eyes, I’ll wager; knowing what beauties abound here under her very nose.”

“And were she truly hideous to behold? If her beauty was of the heart and not to the eye, how would you then compare us? We two maidens you’ve only come to known with your senses.”

She asked this soberly and the men fell to puzzled silence, even Moriam’s smile dropped. The handmaiden sat up and took her friend by the hand,

“Come sister, these two gallants can hardly be wise in the way of truth and beauty given the rather obvious nature of their chosen skins. Accompany me only a little ways into the woods for I feel I need to be away from this fire and wine for a pace or two. Come with me and when we return perhaps our kindly beasts will have found an answer to your curious question.”

She put an arm around the Princess and led her away with a smile back to the men, who even now were handing the wine between them and chuckling in low tones by the fire.

.

“Are you well?” Moriam asked, after they passed through the damp grass to just within the outer line of trees, trees with trunks like twisting bodies. The princess reached out to place herself against a tree, fingering along the gnarls and furrows in its bark. She shook her head with a small frown.

“I don’t know, Moriam,”

“Perhaps we should return to the castle; it is quite late, and we are surely missed.”

The Princess seemed not to hear her,

“I don’t feel sick, but strange all the same. One moment hot and panting,” she faced out to the shaggy figures, black against the fire from this vantage. She could not see them but she felt the warmth from the bonfire and could hear the crackling roar mingle with their easy laughter. She felt Moriam’s fingers on her face, passing softly over the smooth span where eyes should be, now painted. Her lips trembled,

“And the next moment, I feel so cold and forelorn.”

“The boys?” Moriam asked, pulling her friend close and embracing, whispering intimately. The princess shrugged and shook her head as though it were heavy.

“They are boys. Boys at play. When the clear light of day comes, when all this artifice comes undone, we will all be shabby and tired and the fire will have burnt itself out.”

Moriam kissed her friend’s cheek.

“Perhaps. But they are alive and ruddy right now and they find us both beautiful this night.”

The Princess felt something wet and warm,

“Moriam are you crying?”

“Yes, for you cannot. Here, let me stop or I’ll ruin your eyes.”

.

From behind came the two young men, tromping through the rising brush and into the woods to join them.

“What’s this, lovelies? Having a chat? I thought it was the night air you were needing, a walk to stretch your limbs,” it was the orangutang and he reached up to sway from a ponderous branch, creaking the tree. It groaned under his weight and rustled, sending a ripple through the canopy into the night.

“Aye, cousin, I told you they were talking about us. Come back to the fire, angels. It’s not safe here for tight or loose limbs.”

The ape dropped back to the ground with a thump and ambled further into the woods, facing away from them.

“The wine is finished, I’m afraid. Unless you know how to make more.” He laughed heartily and rustled within his costume to relieve himself, bellowing a howling grunt into the murk of the woods.

“Stop that!” Cried Moriam, trying to keep her voice low though insistant, “These woods are not safe, it’s true. You should not have come after us. We were about to return.”

The ape looked over his shoulder at her and then back down to his business. The crow embraced Moriam from behind, nudging his smooth beak against her jaw.

“We thought from the way you two were talking and watching us, that you wished for us to follow. Away from the civilizing fire and into earnest, honest, animal nature.”

“Aye,” said the ape, now finished and turning back to them, “for when nature calls, who can but heed without question?”

The men winked to each other and chortled. Moriam felt feathers touching her delicately. She tore free from his arms and took up the Princess’ hand.

“Good sirs, we will take our leave of you. We can see now that-”

“No,” Said the Princess, reaching down to unclasp her hand and then stepping awkwardly to where she heard and knew the ape to be. He recieved her into his arms with a curious look on his face, but smiling and toothy all the same.

“I think I will stay a little longer, if it pleases you. Go home and I will see you tomorrow.”

“Oh! But sister, you-” She looked to the others, distress on her face, “I cannot return without you!”

The crow hopped closer to her and took her arm, “Do not fear, my dove. I shall accompany you and my cousin will stay with her - through the night if need be, I assure you.”

Moriam looked pained, “But it is so dark, there is no moon...” She said, trailing off meekly.

“I will be fine Moriam, I can feel my way if need be.”

“And I’ll help with that,” said the ape with a lusty grunt.

The couples turned from each other then. The crow led a plaintive and resisting Moriam out of the woods while the ape walked with the Princess further into it, arm in arm.

PART III

“Can you see the flames,” the Great Sow asked, “That circle of fire the humans have built along the edge of our world?”

She sat as immovable as a hillside, her spine nearly cresting the canopy. In the passing years she had grown in size and matter, more and more like a thing of the earth itself. She smelled of rotting wood and clay.

Large and sqatting on her broad neck, her adopted child took his familiar post, holding onto her ears and telling her what he saw. She had long since gone blind. Perhaps with age, perhaps from termites and other burrowing things. She was incalculably old, but only since taking in the ugly whelp had it started to show. She could no longer clearly see the flames, but she heard them, and the human noises beyond them. The heat reached her through the trees, and the trees themselves whispered in terror at the display of such wanton, hungry fire.

He nodded and dug his thick toes into the earth of her scalp, “Yes, Mama. The fire is dancing.” It made his hairs stand up in fright to watch and yet the light was mesmerizing. He could not look far aside before feeling the need to stare back into the play of heat.

“And the humans, do you see them?”

“Yes, Mama. They are dancing, as well.”

She blew a low snort, nodding, “Then you see how they are one and the same. Both would devour the earth, given the chance.” A wind passed through the woods and all around them leaves moaned and rustled in sympathy.

“The fire,” he whispered, his eyes drawn back from the coupling, heedless figures into the flames, “is beautiful.”

She prodded her foot into the ground and shook violently, “It is vile! It burns. It is a flickering, fleeting, mindless beauty. Were you to touch it, were you to embrace it, it would eat you alive and without remorse. Your fat would sizzle in its maw while it still hungered for more. There is no beauty in fire. Only a sad and endless hunger. Lust!” She growled the sound of roots ripping, “They even burn each other when the mood strikes. For being different, for being the same, for being too weak or too strong. It is sickness and insanity.”

She rose with a shuddering effort and turned, “Come. You are older now, and you have watched this long enough. This evil seduces.” He said nothing but looked back still, and dreamed.

.

It was not long before the Great Sow slept. And when she did, she crumbled just a little more. He sprawled on her back and looked up at the stars through the leaves. How much longer until she simply melted away into the ground, leaving a oddly shaped hillock - leaving him alone. She told him often enough that the trees would keep him company, that the Forest was eternal and would provide. He believed her and did not worry for his fate, but as she snored like boulders grinding, as the wind whispered of more beyond the trees, he felt himself restless.

.

He sat up at the sound of an approach. He crouched in the tall grasses of his mother’s mane and felt for a stone as a weapon.

“Relax, piggy. It’s just your Aunt Joga, come to pay a visit.” The hag shuffled out of the gloomy brush, waving and bowing. He relaxed. He grinned, teeth flashing in the night. He dropped down to the ground and scrambled over quickly to embrace her. Joga pushed her knobby fingers over his broad, furred face and pinched his cheeks, examining him.

“My, piglet, you do sprout like a weed.” She clasped his shoulders and thick arms, feeling for meat over bone under skin. She licked her lips, “And more man than boy, I’ll say!” She cackled and he blushed hotly under his hide, looking back at the sleeping mass of his mother. She would never have slept so soundly in the past.

Joga followed his gaze, “I see that I’m too late to come calling. Your mother now sleeps like a stone. I will come another night.” She moved as if to shuffle away and he stopped her.

“Please stay, it is always good to see you.”

The witch sucked her gums and fixed him with an eye, “You have something on your mind.” She whispered roughly, pulling at his arm to walk into forest, “Come and tell me your troubles.”

“We saw the fires tonight. The humans,” he trailed off.

“Quite a show, ne? They can party like moths ablaze!” She jiggled and clapped her hands.

“Are they really so dangerous?”

She spun to a stop and leaned against a tree, wincing and grabbing her aching hip. She caught her breath, “Deadly.”

They shared a somber moment before she licked her lips, “But right fine in a pie!” She slapped her thigh and laughed. He chuckled nervously, Aunt Joga was sometimes quite odd.

She calmed down and pulled at her thin beard, “Now I know what you’re thinking. You got blood in you, much as I do. Your mother might do well to remember that, and what it was like. You see them bodies twisting and fitting together by the fire and you wonder, hmm?”

He nodded, it wasn’t exactly right, but she seemed to be working up to something.

“Well let me tell you, it’s flash and sparks, piggy. It’s Heaven! It can hurt if you do it right but it still feels good when you don’t. More’s the pity to them that don’t want it but must. And thin comfort to those that do and can’t have it.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Bah! Of course you don’t,” she licked her lips, “And I’m too old to show you, frankly. There’s more to it than what I’ve said, but in the end it’s as simple and plain as falling down.”

“Mama says that humans and fire are the same and to stay away from both.”

“Well that’s poetry for you.”

“But do you agree?”

“Your mother is older than humans and fire. Her wisdom is worth remembering.”

“You won’t answer.”

“I am not afraid of being burned,” she stood up to her full height briefly, flaring her nostrils, “I am a witch.” With a sly wink she took his furred hand and, hobbling vigorously, pulled him in the direction of the village, “And right now, I’m feeling an itch in places I thought were long dead. C’mon, piglet, let’s go sightseeing.”

.

The Sow of Sorrows seeped tears like pine sap, her ears full of mulch and dreams. She struggled to rise from her slumber.

= = =
Aunt Joga mumbled as they went, muttering under her breath and signing in the air. She was not talking to him directly so it took some time for him to realize that she was casting a spell. As they drew closer to the edge of the trees he could see her more clearly by firelight. She looked younger - well, not exactly younger, but youthful. She still had all her moles and warts, but they dotted her face like beauty marks and playful freckles on rosy cheeks. She still had her thin bearding whiskers, but they wore like peach fuzz and velvet. Her spine was true and her limbs long and lean. She flared at the hips and even her tattered robes seemed fresh as petals. Her grey hair was a dazzling thick silver, festooned with beads and clever braids. She held a finger to her lips and flashed him a sultry wink. They paused in a shadow and she pointed.

There on the ground tangled two creatures that he first did not recognize as humans. The female was beautiful and appeared to be fae, but he soon saw it was all just paint and costume. The male looked - of all things - like himself! In their struggle the female managed to topple off the male’s head, revealing a second one underneath! It had only been a mask. They were humans playing at being something more, something magical. Why now did they wrestle in the dirt, in the shadows? He was about to speak when Aunt Joga touched her lips to his and shook her head. Her voice entered into him.

Quiet, child. Here is my birthday gift to you.

She released his hand and gave him a last lingering look. Her skin tight and bronzed and smooth. She smiled, turning away in scarves and bells as a gypsy and a dancer.

.

“What’s this? What’s this?” Joga laughed, affecting a stagger. The ugly man crouched in the brush to watch quietly, his hairs raised all over his body.

Joga reached down to the orangutan and pulled him off the Princess. She stood tall and drank from a bottle of wine.

“I come out to commune with nature and find beasts and babes entangled like pups over scraps.” She laughed richly and the man in the costume blushed, standing up quickly. He dusted his chest and snatched up his mask. Joga seemed to match his height with ease.

“Oh, off with ya, wench!”

The Princess rolled away, hugging herself and curling onto her side. Her dress was torn to the waist, her hair had come undone. She sobbed without crying.

“Tsk, there there, pigeon.” Joga crouched and helped the Princess to her feet. She looked her over and then to the man. He seemed agitated and avoided her gaze, holding his grotesque head in his hands.

“Such a girl on such a night? A big strong man like you?” Joga stepped to him and her glamour bloomed about them both. He faced her and blushed.

“Surely you’d prefer a full woman your own size, than this... child.” She traded him the mask for the jug of wine. He could not resist and already his eyes were travelling over Joga’s body, the Princess long forgotten. The witch placed the mask over her own head and her eyes sparkled through the holes. She leaned closer to him and groped for his crotch.

“For these two buttons,” she squeezed, “I’ll be your beast.”

She kissed the lips of the mask to his jaw and neck. They moved as though alive and her own and she bit him visibly. He grunted, but was otherwise blind to the oddness of this transformation. He reached a wide paw to her waist, nodding wordlessly and she led him away without a backwards glance.

.

The ugly man waited in the dark. The Princess had slouched against a tree and was sniffling to herself, curling her toes in the earth and rocking. After a while she seemed to calm down, turning her face this way and that as if searching. He saw that her eyes were wide open however, a strange expression on her decorated face. She was beautiful. Not in the dusky way of Joga’s fleshy magic, but attractive like dew on spidersilk, the sound of snowmelt trickling. He crawled closer and she turned to face his hiding place.

“Who’s there?”

Her open eyes stared directly into his own and he held his breath. She did not blink. She asked again, stepping briefly towards him, then stumbling back.

“Who approaches! Moriam!”

She seemed on the verge of panic and he felt his pulse quicken. She would surely fall, flailing like that.

“Be careful! It is only I.” He said it without thinking, seeing only tripping roots and sharp rocks. She tilted her head, looking away but showing her ear.

“Only I? Have you returned then? Was she too much for you? Leave me alone!” And then, meekly, after a hesitation, “Do you know who I am?”

“No,” he sat in front of her. “And that man is gone. I suspect he will be eaten - in a pie, perhaps.”

She snorted, abruptly startled.

“Why do you pretend to be a fairy?”

She raised her eyebrows, then touched her clothes, her face.

“It’s festival; we’re all something we’re not.” She backed into a tree and felt along its bark to sit against it, facing him. Her hands crawled like spiders around her, one finding a stone, the other a loose stick. She drew both nearer.

“Is that really what I look like?”

“Well, at first. But I can see that it’s not real.”

“And you, what are you?”

“What do you mean?”

“For the festival.”

“It is no holiday to me.”

She shook her head. “But that’s silly, everyone knows-”

“You have no eyes!” He rolled onto his hands and knees, closer to see the truth of it. It was strange how she never blinked, but then, just then, by the distant light, he saw her smooth face beneath the paint. She pulled the stone into her lap, it too was smooth.

“Yes. I am the princess.” Her title was meaningless to him. He crouched closer, curious. She left the stone in her lap and tore a length from her ruined dress. She wiped at her face and smirked.

“Usually that elicits some response.” But still he was quiet, marvelling at her. She pushed the hair from her brow and used the rag to tie it back.

“Who are you?” She asked. She sensed his presence, his heat closer now, his scent much like the man in the costume but with a peculiar edge to it that she could not place.

“My mother never named me, but my Aunt calls me ‘Piglet’ or ‘Piggy’.”

“Well that’s just awful.”

Closer still and the Princess could only picture her father’s hounds after a hunt, heated and rangy. How strange this fellow should make her think that.

“You tease me. You are in costume,” she reached for him, abruptly fumbling her fingers into his chest and spreading them upon his fur.

“You-”

He tensed beneath her touch. Her fingers hot like embers pushing through his hide. She followed one hand with the other, combing her fingers along his broad shape. He thought of humans and fire and leaned away from her. She tugged at him.

“But... this is beautiful. You must tell me how you made this.” Her fingers found snarls and matted patches, burrs and twigs, and swooping passages of plush velvet along his sides. He was facinatingly textured; here it was coarse, and there thin and fine. And under it all, beat a delicious warmth and mass. She thought of horse flanks and raw dough from the kitchen, cottowool and crackling dry leaves. Her hands found the shapes and colors she had always imagined.

It was real - he was real. She had enjoyed the rough artifice of the orangutan costume, but that was mere shadow to this living substance, smoke to this blaze. She pushed her face into his neck and breathed deeply. His hair mingled with her own.

.

The Great Sow crumbled more and more with each heavy step. Her eyes were gummy with sap and she blundered into treetrunks, splintering them aside. Her child was gone. Joga had bewitched him. Or the fires. She snorted out vermin and drooled stumpwater, shedding her flesh in clods from old granite bones. The trees in her path screamed silently, the others wailing in her ears. They told her where to go, they guided her so she would not blindly rampage among them.

There is your bastard seed! Spare us!

She thundered upon them, finding them entwined; some filthy human thing marking her cherished. Her eyes blurred over, her nostrils ran, she gnashed her terrible teeth and reared above the treetops, blotting out the sky.

She howled for him to move aside so that she might trample the human to jelly. But he could not, paralyzed by fright, unable to understand her earthy cries as her throat fell to rubble. She now frightened him. Together the two cowered before her and she wailed as she found she could not tell them apart.

“You betray me, my child! My wretched, dear child.” She collapsed, falling upon them both and feeling their soft hands clawing at the clay of her belly. Inside, the Sow’s stone heart broke sharply in two and she trembled into a smothering heap, like a fresh grave mound.

PART IV

Guards and villagers with torches and shovels, axes and spears, surged into the woods beyond the fires. Moriam was with them, as was the King himself. Gawkers came with them still in costume.

“Here! I left her here.” Moriam flew to the hillock and dug into dirt with her bare hands. She sobbed and was joined quickly by others. Even the King was soon up to his elbows in roots and grime.

Digging together, it was not long before the limp bodies of the two were uncovered, and then they both were hauled free.

The King knelt to embrace his daughter. Soldiers held the shaggy beast that was with her. Both were bare and soiled, unconscious but alive. Moriam pointed to the slumped bulk of the ugly man, “Sire! This is the one! He was with her when I left!”

Moriam had to be restrained. She was wild with rage and struggled as thought to tear the ugly man to pieces. The King gave his instructions to those around him.

“I will return to the castle with my daughter. You, run ahead and fetch the doctor.” He gestured at Moriam, “And take her to the nunnery, I will tend to her punishment.” He held a torch low to the slack face of the ugly man, now mired with dirt and worms. “Weight him with stones. I want him in the moat.”

“Who is it?” Cried one from the crowd.

“Yes, take off his mask! Who did this to the Princess!” The crowd gathered in outrage, torches bobbed about and the trees watched in silence, aghast.

The King surveyed the hateful, twisted faces flickering in shadow and light. He spoke,

“No! This one wears the disguise of a monstrous beast and he will suffer likewise! For that skin fits him better than his own bare flesh. I want no name from him! I’ll have no name follow my child like a spectre past this night!” And then to his guard, “Give him to the mob, but see that he drowns.”

.

They wrested a stone rib from the earthen pile and carried it with the ugly man from the woods, through the village to the castle moat. He lolled like a carcass above their heads, passed roughly from hand to hand, prodded with rakes and pikes until his fur slopped red with blood. He moaned pitiously and gagged out clots of dirt from his lungs, delerious.

The throes of the festival turned easily to outrage as the mob swelled in size and spirit. Many joined the procession with no understanding of what was going on, merely eager to partake in the drunken spectacle.

“Burn him!” “Hang him!” “Who is it?”

But the soldiers were resolute, “Any who unmask this man will share his fate!”

Somewhere among the crowd, with the eyes of a coward, the Crow watched the torture and drowning of his presumed kin. He sobbed within his mask.

.

“Well now, Joga,” She asked herself, licking her lips clean, “What will you do to make this right?”

She exited from the tent, an old and bent woman. She went unnoticed amid the tumult of the night. She heard the uproar and walked away from it. Soon the Princess would wake and streak from the castle in some lovestruck effort to save her new, friendly beloved. Soon but not soon enough. He would be dead and below the water. Were this all fate, she would shrug and shamble on. But this was not fate. This was by her meddling hand. And to do nothing invited trouble, for such was justice in this world. Some how, some way, she would suffer in balance. This she knew; she and the silent trees. She clutched her sack of buttons, her jostling horde, each one-half of a pair, like the eyes of a simple doll.

“What can I do? I am an old-”

“Nonsense, you are Joga the Witch, terrible and cunning. With heartbreak you have killed the Great Sow of Sorrow when knights with swords and priests with fire have failed. What do you fear from mortal rabble?”

“I did not want to kill her.”

“You used to want her power.”

“Her power? Her dominion? Over what, the Forest?” She shook her head, “No, no. We had become friends. Anyway, it is too late. He will die and she will follow in a young lover’s suicide or some such. This story is the same. Perhaps in memorial I could transform her into a willow tree by the water’s edge.”

“That is small thinking. You are still guilty and you know it.”

“I can silence you.”

“I would like to see you try.”

.

She was not the only one shunning the torchlit scene by the water’s edge. She saw the crow staggering, heard his cries and sensed in him a kindred conscience.

“Oh poor cousin! My blood and kin, I am a coward!” He trailed black feathers and tears, dropping an empty bottle, drunk.

“You there, black bird.” She rapped on his beak, “What’s this about?”

“They are killing my cousin, I left him to his doom, the poor fool.”

“So you did, so you did. I can hear even now how they ready the weight about his belly. Such jeering madness!” She patted his black ruff, sucking her gums thoughtfully.

“I would give anything to save him and flee this horrid place.”

“Your cousin has earned his reward, but give me two buttons and I will help you save the one they mean to kill.”

.

Soldiers kept the crowd off the bridge across the moat. The ugly man lay in a stain of his own blood, his body matted with it, cut and broken and bruised. The stone rib had been tied to his waist by a length of sturdy rope and several men struggled to pick them both up. They began to heave, slowly swaying him and he looked up through bruised, swollen eyes to see past their dark faces. A black angel circled closer to carry him away.

His vision swam before him and he was falling through the air, touching the water, feeling it swallowing him in a cold, luxuriously numbing, wet embrace.

It lasted only an instant before he was wrenched out, the silence of the moat emerging into the roar of the crowd and the rush of great wings. He swung, twisting from the rope, and the world fell away from him. All those astonished upturned faces, those small torches growing smaller still.

Aunt Joga was cackling, riding a great black bird, her grey hair whipping in the wind. He passed out, streaming blood from his lips into the night sky.

## She of the sea

SHE OF THE SEA

"Look at this one," She held up a pebble the size and shape of old penny candy. It was quite slick from the ocean and dribbled down her fingers. She squinted and smiled to him; her fingers muddy, her feet sandy up to her ankles. He held his flip-flops and her sandals, trailing behind her as she padded along the ocean's edge.

She picked through strewn crabshells and litter, the endless tangles of seaweed, and found small stones like this, flat and smoothed over. She collected them into her hand, making sure to show him each one.

"This one's got a stripe that goes all the way around." And so it did. As they meandered, the ocean crept up to them, each wave thinning and shallow as a puddle after all that crashing noise. Each wave licked at their feet and then just as quickly receeded, slipping back to join the others. The water was too cold for him and he avoided these approaches. However she let the waves rustle luxuriously over her toes and spatter the hem of her skirt.

When the water fell away, she stooped to pluck up another small stone. She held it up as if to see it closer, and then secretly tasted it. He could see this, though she turned to hide the motion from him.

If it were night, she would have stripped and dashed headlong into the deep.

And he would have said lamely, "Here, I'll hold your clothes so they don't get sandy." She would have poured the gathered stones carefully into his hands, handed him her crumpled garments, kissed his cheek and left him blushing and flustered on the shore by the moonlit dark water to watch.
## Galactus and the little prince

GALACTUS AND THE LITTLE PRINCE

So one night, the Little Prince wakes up to find that Galactus is hovering just beyond the tiny sphere of his planet, looking famished.

"GALACTUS MUST FEED" says the grand force of nature, clad in aurora and magenta. His voice booms across the cosmos and snuffs out a dozen stars.

"Mais, ma planète est très petite," says the Little Prince quietly, tying his robe around himself. It is soft and cozy and he is still in his pajamas.

"THIS IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I WILL CONSUME ALL BEFORE ME AND I WILL NOT BE DENIED." Galactus turns his gaze down upon the surface of the small planet and squints his eyes; for it is very small indeed and the Little Prince himself is but a boy.

"Mais monsieur, ma fleur mourra. Je l'aime."

"I AM THE EATER OF WORLDS." They had reached an impasse.

"Ma planète est trop salée et vous n'aimerez pas le goût," proclaims the Little Prince, honestly. He goes to his kitchen for a large spoon and scoops up a heaping of dirt. He offers it to Galactus who looks at him for a long, long time before accepting the sample.

"THE UNIVERSE IS VAST AND I AM ETERNAL. IN TIME, I WILL DEVOUR ALL WORLDS. IN TIME, YOURS TOO WILL JOIN ETERNITY IN MY BEING - BUT NOT TODAY. IN TIME, YOU WILL GROW OLD AND DIE. AND IN TIME, YOUR FLOWER WILL WITHER AND DIE WITH YOU. WHEN I RETURN, YOU BOTH WILL HAVE PASSED INTO DUST. I WILL THEN FEED UPON THIS SMALL WORLD AND I WILL THINK OF YOU."

Then the great being Walked Away. He shook terribly with hunger and ground his great teeth, spraying a dozen comets into the void. The Little Prince watched him go. He watered the rose that he loved so dearly and promised to be faithful, and then he shuffled back to bed. He dreamed - not just that night, but thereafter into his old age - of shooting stars and the broad, spanning footprints of gods.
## Death

DEATH

this is how it'll happen:

Death'll come in the form of Josephine Baker, friendly and warm and brown and ever smiling and playful. And it won't be this scary thing, why would it be? just an entertainer from the 30s, from the jazz age and all that earthy physicality and rag. but she'll be southern, like my mama, and she'll take my hand and say a joke or something to break the ice before we go.

and Hanuman will be with her, just in case there's any trouble or need for heroism, but it won't really be Hanuman, it'll be Sun Wu Kung because i always get them mixed up. that won't be important though, because there won't be any trouble; it'll be like going to out to dinner with friends you haven't seen in a while.

and i'll ask if all the people that mattered will be there, my friends and my family, and she'll say she doesn't know but that we could find out together. it'll be just like Neil Gaiman describes except that Death will be Josephine Baker instead of that girl from the comics because Josephine would know all the Billie Holiday songs and could show me a dance or two on the way.
## The vicars champion

THE VICAR'S CHAMPION

The Warrior had no time to waste; smoke from the burning village further blackened the stormy sky above the valley. Distant crashes and cries of battle carried clearly to her on chilling winds. She spurred her mount, digging into its belly, into wounds made from a night of goading and hard riding. The creature was spent and foamed at the mouth, but still it galloped on. She felt it gnawing at the bit. It thrummed between her thighs, broad and powerful, mesmerizing in its way. Only a few more rises and then the drop down into the valley. She did not allow herself to think that she might already be too late. Her legs were numb, her fingers cramping. She held her position just off the saddle, using her knees, digging her heels, her head down and close to the hot neck of the beast, breathing its scent in and out.

She was clearly too late to save the village, but it could not all be cinders yet. She would still find the child as she promised, though dead or alive. But if there was still fighting, there was hope. She was exhausted and her vision blurred, filling with tears from smoke. She trusted the mount to find its own way and simply ground her spurs steadily, mindlessly, whispering along the creature's dank lathered hide to hurry and to fly.

The rhythmic blast of its flecked breath churned out steam into the air. The air was damp and cool here in the highlands; the village could not have burned through completely. Her spurs were catching in the flesh.

"You should not have returned," said the Vicar's Champion, rumbling low and honeyed all around her. Her head pounded with fever, her vision swirled into drizzle and ashes and mud. She clung to the mount with a feeble brittle strength and closed her eyes.

"I made a vow, surely you would understand that," she whispered, rocked gently on thick working muscles. Though they were almost to the crest of the last rise, the melee just beyond it sounded far, far away. Only her heartbeat now, and the thudding gallop, and the stinging burnt air in her lungs.

"You made a vow, but you are pledged to the dead. Even now the fighting is among the victors. Those you would save have been slain. The child you would adore has been consumed. Your purpose here has ended," he said this and she faught back dispair.

"You are not death. My purpose is my own. Can you say the same?"

"I serve my master's will."
## Heather hill

HEATHER HILL

"I'm a blueberry," she said. "See? Look here and say if I'm not."

She held out two small hands, cupping four dusky round berries, dark as navy gems and still wet from the rain. Her face was wet as well, and somewhere far below in the shadows of the grass, her toes twined and curled in the dirt. She was happy and wild; happiest now just after the rains, with the grey clouds still circling and low. I could refuse her nothing. I tried hard to make this image of her - right now - fix itself in my mind.

"It is just as you say," I confessed and she delicately ate them from her palms like they were secrets. All around this hill, the bushes were heavy with them; a multitude of blueberry stars, each in midnight purples against dark green leaves. As she licked her fingers clean, she watched me with interest.

"And you are old tea leaves." Down she squatted, pulling her thin dress over her knees. She hugged herself and rocked in the grass. Cool damp soil, more black now than brown.

"Aren't we a pair," she said and furrowed her brow. The wind kept blowing her hair to her face where it stuck. She shuddered from a chill.

"You will get sick, we should go back inside."

"You worry too much. I don't mind being sick. I can breathe in air like this. Look down into that valley, it is soaked and fresh and cold. All the smothering heat from before is knocked out of the air, rinsed back into the earth." She dropped her fingers to the ground and dug out fistfuls. I would not have been surprised to see her eat from them. She ground her fingers together so the mud fell away in clods.

"We won't have many more days like this. And so what if I get sick? If I do, it will be because this day has entered into me bodily, and I rather fancy that notion. My disease would last as a testament, long after the clouds have gone."

"Well then, I will get sick." She glanced up at me as though I had insulted her.

"No you won't. You are immune; you resist all these charms."

"All but yours."

"Yes," she smiled, and it was again all right. We filled our pockets with more berries and wandered down into the valley to play among the old cannons and ruined concrete bunkers. When the sun did finally burn through, it found us perched upon a crumbling dome, watching the fading storm clouds on the horizon. We strained our ears in serious, devotional silence, and sought to hear - for as long as we could - the low and fading thunder.

## Have no fear

HAVE NO FEAR

A bulb of garlic near the cutting board and a few cloves resting next to it like a squat loving mother with her babes. That's what he thought looking at the small tableau.

"So," he said by way of breaking the silence, "Mama called." Sarah sat at the table while he worked dicing peppers. "While you were asleep."

She exhaled in the direction of the open window and only blinked in reply.

She pulled her foot onto the chair, hanging her toes off the edge, her heel in her crotch. She always smoked in his kitchen because they were siblings and she could get away with it.

He used the flat of the blade to scoop up the cuttings into a bowl and then he started on the onion. The scent was sharp and sudden. The view from the window overlooked the plaza, where youths on ladders hung strings of lanterns and garlands of small piñatas from poles for later that night. Clustered in the shade of the cork tree sat town elders, fanning themselves and slouched. They were jovial, he could tell that much, though at this distance, only tone of voice carried.

"She called and asked about you again, wanted to know how long you were going to stay here." Sarah shrugged and carefully tapped her ashes. She looked at him and he watched his fingers, the garlic nearby like small sugar skulls.

"She said it wasn't right for you to be away like this. Away from your husband." Sarah brushed her hair behind her ear.

"And what did you say?"

"What could I say? 'I don't know', I told her. I said you were still figuring things out. I said you were asleep."

Sarah furrowed her brow, assessing this carefully. She nodded and pulled up her other foot, now sitting crosslegged in the chair. She crushed out her cigarette and then dug both hands into her thick hair and scratched her scalp vigorously.

"Thanks," she mumbled, sighing out a tired grunt. She flopped her hands down into her lap and sniffed.

"What am I going to do? I have to go back for my clothes if nothing else." He nodded and listened; he cut the onion into futher smaller pieces the way he knew she liked it.

## Fiction by the numbers by the sea

FICTION BY THE NUMBERS, BY THE SEA

Tracy was on the case.

Franklin "The Fist" Jones, a hopeful with dreams of a shot at the title.

It seems while Jones was bringing home nickels and old fish from his job at the docks or beating patched sacks of sand at the gym, his younger brother Timbo was living the fast life. Too fast. And now he needed help; he was in over his head in debt to local shark and dilettante, Glitterface.

"How much do you owe, Timbo?"

"More than you got, but I've got this plan, see?"

Timbo had a gun, it was their old man's service revolver. And with the old man long since dead in a box, Timbo felt the pistol might as well see the light of day.

"Where'd you get that, Timbo?"

"Aw, you know Ma kept this on the shelf in her closet. It'll be easy, nobody has to get hurt. Look, it's empty!"

"Don't point that at me. I don't like this; I could just get another job."

"Save your strength, killer. I know you do rounds on the weekend. You work too hard as it is. Get a little more sleep and you'll dodge that fist a little quicker next time, eh?"

He chuckled and Jones looked away, the shiner still raw on his face from the night before.

"I won that fight, Timbo."

"Sure you did. Now listen, big brother: here's what we need to do."

Timbo had a plan, a heist; simple and easy.

And as Jones listened, watching his brother's eyes dance with cunning and the way he fingered the cylinder on the gun he remembered the two of them as boys, skinny and nervous by the deathbed of their father. That flabby hand on his shoulder and those eyes that'd seen too much war.

"You, my son. My eldest. You are the man now. Watch over your mother and Timothy." The hand in his hair and then folded over the other on that rattling chest, eyes closing, "My good boy."

The gun wasn't even loaded, nobody would get hurt.

Wobbles drove the car. Jones and Timbo went in, easy as you please. Tim had a grin on his face the whole time. He was jovial about it, joking around with that iron in his hand. Jones had a baseball bat. He felt ridiculous and terrified, wearing his mother's hose over his face and asking some pretty piece to put the money in the bag. The teller looked at him with utter fear in her face and he felt the old man's hand in his hair, his thumb rubbing his forehead.

But he was a fighter and he tamped all that down and shook his fist to get her moving.

"That's it, champ. Way to handle the ladies." Timbo was laughing, waving the gun at the guard. He hadn't been drinking, but he was drunk all the same. The rush of it all. "That's my brother. He's going to make the papers, one day," he said, then cackled, "and not just for this!"

And they were in and out. Mere minutes. Wobbles cranked the wheel this way and that, yapping to Timbo who still had the gun in his hand. He couldn't keep his eyes on the road, he kept looking at the cash. Timbo had dumped the bag into his lap and was rocking back and forth with it. The two of them like jackals.

Jones slumped deep into the back seat and looked at the bricks and steel swirl by. His head was pounding, his black eye pulsing and tender. Later that night he was home cooking for his mother, and later, sitting in prayer with her.

Tracy was on the case. Witnesses described two men, one was a talker, kind of a weasel, the other a brute with a bat. Scuffed knuckles and a black eye. The teller remembered his hands. Someone else remembered the "champ". He was a detective and he was on the case. In little time, the police were snooping around, dropping in to the gyms around the city and asking about fighters.

But it was all settled, they'd gotten away clean and nobody knew nothing. So when the coppers came around he lied with a straight face. He was in the ring, pounding on Sully for practice. Both had the headgear on. He was heated and loose, he spit to the side and gave his alibi. On his way out, Tracy wished him luck with his local title fight. He knew something, alright. He knew nothing, of course. Jones was rattled.

And of course, that wasn't the end of things. With the robbery, nothing was settled. Glitterface was happy to get his money back, but he was no fool. It was in all the papers. And who owns the banks? The mob. The mob had a hand in everything, and some punk with a gun wasn't going to last long stealing their hard-earned bankvaulted cash. But to someone like Glitterface, Timbo had his uses. To deliver Timbo into the right hands might make a don or two a little grateful, might earn a few favors, down the road.

"A pleasure doing business with you, Timbo, a real pleasure," he said, with oil and promise in his voice.

Jones was furious. There in the kitchen with Timbo and Wobbles, the two of them dressed in ridiculous fashions.

"Hey, keep it down, killer. You don't want to wake Ma, do you?"

"How can you be working for that trash, now? Just last week he was going to break your legs."

"It was business, big brother."

"Is that what you are, now? You two businessmen?"

Timbo had a plan. And bullets; this time the old man's gun was loaded.

The fights kept him busy, kept him keen and numb at the same time. And he kept winning. He came home to find his mother asleep in front of the radio and he kissed her forehead. She woke with the voice of a child and called him by his father's name. The wins came, the honest prize money came. He needed to smuggle home fish less and less.

Then, across the hall, this dame moved in - No, not a dame - that would've been Timbo's word for a woman. And she was too mousey and plain for all that, anyway. But there she was and they both fumbled awkwardly around each other in passing on the stairs. She wore a cross and no wedding ring.

"Franklin, come and see who's here." His mother was sitting with her on the couch. He was just in from training. He was sapped and bruised and felt too big for the small apartment. She was sitting there with his mother and they were holding hands.

"Franklin, look. This is Mary, she lives right across the hall. Isn't that funny? I made such a fool of myself today with the groceries and she was kind enough to help me. Oh, we've been talking all evening!"

Jones grunted and pulled his hat from his head.

"That's great Ma," then to her he nodded, "Miss."

"Franklin works by the water, dear."

And life went on accordingly. Eventually. Predictably. These arcs are obvious and gracefully simple. Timbo's little schemes get out of hand. He seems to think he's clever and a survivor, but it's only because Jones has always been there to save his ass. He thinks he has it all under control. Wobbles is an idiot, but a loyal follower. Glitterface is brutal and cold-blooded. He strings Jones along, letting him dig his grave a little deeper and using him in the meanwhile to advance his own agenda, eventually turning on him. He finds a way to coerce Timbo into getting Jones to throw his title fight. Perhaps it's the girl. Perhaps it's their mother. There's another heist. This time without Jones. Jones wants nothing more to do with Timbo's "business" ventures. It goes badly, perhaps Wobbles screws up. Somebody is shot but not killed. The threads get only slightly fuzzy after that. But you know the rest, I'm sure. Eventually it all reduces to Jones facing down an oncoming, obliterating, last wide fist to his broken face and deciding to embrace it or not. These things are all about choosing to throw the fight. You enter into and leave this world alone.

"I will save you. Come with me and I will care for you."

He tucks the creature into his clothing to keep it warm.

It soon writhes with renewed vigor and fatally bites him.

"Fool! You knew I was a snake when you took me in."

THE TOP

The lovers two spiraled about each other
wobbling swiftly and spinning
two blue stars painted upon a old wooden top
flecked with red and white
    oak worn smooth by the
    hands of children on the floor
    and in the sunlight
this was a gift from grandpa
    flowers in a jar
    set in the open window
    facing the ocean
these were a gift from grandma
linen and sand and
grass and salt and
bottleglass
they both loved the ocean
and in doing so, they
never argued the rest of their
tidal seaside days
## Grass

GRASS

They skipped stones by the pond in the dark and to the sound of frogs, crickets, and their own easy banter. They walked along the train tracks by moonlight, one after the other, balanced on the same rail. And then again side by side on both rails, reaching out to touch their fingers together for balance.

They sat on the old slat bridge, dangling their legs above the river and staring downstream to the glowing sky in the distance; the sky above the far, twinkling city.

They rustled about in tall grasses and held each other as the wind swayed the leaves about them and echoed their whispers to each other and to eternity.

They promised to always be friends. Would they spit and shake on it? Yes, and so they did. And they kissed, lightly on the lips and each eyelid. The way mothers kiss their children off to war; the way fathers kiss their daughters.

"My train leaves in the morning, and I can see it's almost dawn."

"Stay with me, please. Here in the tall grass, here where we are hidden and safe."

"I have to go, and I am afraid."

"But if you go, if this ends, we will forget. There will be work and family, age and death and change. And then this-"

"Then this will seem like a dream half-remembered."

"We can hide from the sun. We can pull this grass around us."

"If I whisper to you that I love you..."

"It will be all that I can hear."

"And if I tangle with you in this secret field..."

"It will become ours and all that I need."

"And if I miss my train to stay here with you..."

"Then you will give up the world and joys of your own making for this moment and the promise of this night."

"You cannot promise me endless nights of green fields and caresses."

"And you will not stay to find out."

"I can stay until the dawn, but even now the light is changing."

"Kiss me, quickly."
## Music

MUSIC

"Joshua, turn that down. I can still hear it."

Her son shot her a look of pure, cold, hard death in the rearview mirror and thumbed at the device. He slouched even further in the seat and bobbed his head, looking out the car window with resumed, majestic apathy.

The volume may have decreased, but she couldn't tell. She could still hear the incessant thumping bassline and the scratchy angry lyrics that occasionally resolved into epithets.

She dug her nails into her palms around the steering wheel. The veins on the back of her hands writhed.

He had this thing lately where he would ride in the back like she was his driver. His gangly legs folded, just so, to dig his knees into her seat. When the chorus came in he would slap out the beat on his lap or drum his fingers against the glass.

What drove her up the wall, however, weren't his antics. She had done her reading on parenting, spoken with her elders and her experienced "mom" friends. She knew well enough that she and her son were powerless before tyrants: hormones and the quests for self-identity, for pussy, and possibly for penis. She'd found all his pornography long ago.

No, what was digging its hooks into her skin more than anything else was the simple fact that her son and child and flesh was abjectly tone deaf. The fact that he listened to snarling overpaid idiots encouraging him to rape and vice didn't bother her nearly as much as the fact that he couldn't keep pace with the rhythm and the rhyme scheme.

It was only through force of will that she kept from swerving the car into a curb, reaching back and snatching off his headphones to shriek in full fury,

"LISTEN! GOD DAMN IT... CAN'T YOU FUCKING LISTEN. IT'S NOT: uh UH UH these BITCHES ain't SHIT to me. THE EMPHASIS IS CLEAR AND PLAIN: uh UH uh THESE bitches ain't SHIT to me. IT IS NOT THAT HE WANTS YOU TO GET THE POINT THAT WOMEN ARE BITCHES, BUT THAT THESE FUCKING WOMEN IN FUCKING PARTICULAR ARE BITCHES. AND THERE'S A MELODY, A SIMPLE LITTLE MELODIC HOOK TO THE CHORUS. SIXTEEN NOTES. LIKE A GOD DAMNED NURSERY RHYME; WHY CAN'T YOU FOLLOW IT? WHY CAN'T YOU CARRY A TUNE? IT'S IN A MAJOR KEY FOR FUCK'S SAKE, IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. AT ALL. I WAS FIRST CLARINET FOR MY ENTIRE FOUR YEARS AT STATE. I WON CONTESTS - CONTESTS. I FUCKED YOUR FATHER IN THE ORCHESTRA PIT FOR 'CARMEN' IN PARIS AND I BLEW THE CONDUCTOR ON THE SIDE. I FUCKING HELPED HIM WITH HIS ARRANGEMENTS - REWROTE THE PART FOR VIOLA FOR THE ARIA MYSELF, AND THE WEDDING MARCH FOR THAT ASSHOLE'S SECOND MARRIAGE. AND WHY. THE FUCK. ARE YOU. MY. CHILD."
## Gravity

GRAVITY

Careening through dust and void
hurtling and spinning all wobbly specks,
mere specks, scattered like so much flour
onto surface before the dough is kneaded.
Per·func·to·ri·ly, out of habit

And in the rhythm of the the baker working the dough,
dashing out fingerfuls of flour onto wood worn smooth
before knuckling into the soft mass
leaning weight into it and rolling the shoulders
Dusted just like that

I watched the bread that would be crust form as though by magic.
Protein chains forming and tangling and setting into shape
to pass from one's hands into another
as something made and crafted according to a pattern
determined long ago.

"What are you staring at? Pay the man."

It was just pizza after all and
we shared it by the window bundled into winter clothes
with mittens removed and placed beside us,
our mittens touching as though we were still holding hands.

She knitted them as a matching set of four; his and hers, left and right.
We ate and the sleet came down
and the world was grey and spinning madly through the deep,
the bare and dusty unknowable deep.

Less than a blink - less and shorter than that -
I was there with her then and we ate
and the rock turned quickly beneath us;
tumbling, clinging to us as we cling to it.

That's gravity for you:
everything reaches out for everything else.
Stay and hold me.
That's gravity, right? Don't go away.
The sun does this. And the moon, and the dust.
Of course the bigger you are, the more you pull.
But everything pulls in some small way.

Please stay here close to me, right?
This thin little smear of life on the falling rock,
like grease on our fingers, thinner than even that.
And we cling to the earth and it clings to us.
It's gravity saying come closer, closer still,
all of you, gather around me and stay,
why are we so scattered apart and flying apart?

Please don't leave me alone.
Rain on the glass, neon in the window, clouds overhead
We eat together and the flesh works our little speck lives
a little further along, a little slower, a little older, a little less efficiently.
The errors accumulate, bones brittle a little more,
the brain fogs a little bit.

In 30 years, if we're lucky, we'll still be together,
aching and pained on raining, sleeting days like this.
Joints that long lost their elasticity will suffer the changing pressures
and it will ache for us to be out on miserable rainy days.
Winters will gnaw at us a little more intently.
There'll be love there, still,
mixed with simple familiarity
and the shared experience
and routine
of two people who decided to hold hands until this rock spins itself out;
routine slowly going erratic and slowing and wobbling
like tops spinning out their energy and starting to shudder,
skittering to a sudden, clattering stop;
finally, endlessly calm and still.

And as for the planet, in a little while yet, it too will be consumed by the Sun. It won't make any sense, but it won't matter either. Do you know how old Old will be by then? Yeah, sure, years from now, eons from now, supernova eventuality, but come on, nothing lasts forever. And so: gravity - gravity is something alone reaching for everything around itself saying, "Don't go, come here and stay with me until this is over." 60 years? 70, if you're lucky. Maybe 80, if you don't smoke. 90, if your genes are right - and even then the earth itself will die, eventually. Right out from under your feet.

The Sun pulls at those passing comets, each so bright and in a hurry, and the Earth pulls at the slowly receding Moon, and the Moon pulls at the Earth. And the trash in the gutter pulls at Mars and that new planet nobody knew about and still has trouble accepting, even that thing way out there, it's pulling at you too, and your mother misses you and wishes you'd call more often and she's pulling at you too, to come close and closer still and to stay. All the things you don't know about, will never learn about, and will never do or see in your life, those things are still pulling at you too, in all directions, just as you're pulling at everything in return. And all those letters you meant to write or never sent, they pull at you, and you pull at them. That's gravity. Gravity is that ache for connection made real, and that's just the way it works. It's not magic - I don't make this stuff up.
## Angel

ANGEL

In the dream, I am lurching homewards through the city late at night, and I am stumbling drunk. It is not a real drunkenness, because in the way of dreams I am lucid and observing as though trapped in my unsteady body. I am unable to place my feet correctly, unable to force my eyes to keep focus. I know that I'm drunk, but I cannot remember how. The other night owls give me a wide berth and they turn to watch me sway along. I want to tell them that I'm sober, that I'm fine. But all that comes from my raw lips is garbled speech. I look disheveled. I must have thrown up because the taste is in my mouth and my shirt is soaked and stinking. I feel like a zombie.

I stagger into an alley and have to pause at a dumpster to retch onto the ground. I cannot make sense of what comes out. I don't remember dinner. In the mess, I can see pale, oddly blue specks that look like they might be undissolved pills. It is damp and chilly out but I am sweating with a fever. My throat is raw from stomach acid.

I look up to see a radiant figure, male, nude, hairless, and glowing magenta. His arms taper to neat amputations at the wrists. From where his eyes should be reach the hands of a child. The fingers are clasped across his face in a way that looks like a mask, but also reminds me of my grandmother, sitting on her fading couch, clasping her fingers in her lap while looking out the window. Looking away through windows when she spoke of my father, the soldier and the hero. Her hands touching each other lightly, fingers interlacing. She spoke in reverent tones, "He was such a good boy. My little man. You look just like him." This figure hovers a foot in the air with arms out like Jesus, and he waits for me to swallow my bile.

It is perfectly natural, serene even. That ruddy light burns away the stink and the drunkenness. I can stand up straight, though it makes me ache all over, and even that ache begins to fade the longer I look at him. The city fades away around us both, and he says to me, in strange choral tones, "You are besieged." The hands unfurl from each other, both pointing to me as clearly as any gaze. His breath brings more light, and it streams into me, entering my senses intimately. I nod and lick my cracked, raw lips.

"I think I am sick. Can you help me?" My voice trembles. He is beautiful and sincere, and I feel no need to resist. His hands come together touching his thumbs to his brow in a gesture of prayer. He bows his head.

"I am simply the message. Will you hear it?" Closer he drifts to me, leaning down to kiss, and those hands that are eyes reach for my face with tingling caresses. I open my lips to draw him in, and our teeth clash like sparks and embers. He is warm to the touch, and the embrace feels like a longing fulfilled, like prophecy on the eve of revelation, like coming home from a cruel sea.

I cannot find the words - and when it is over, he pulls away from me with one hand reaching down to cover his mouth, the other reaching up to clasp his bare brow in spread fingers. Those hands like eyes. My heart pounds; I ache for more of this strange connection, and I reach out and through him.

But he is already receding as a dream within a dream, tilting his head as though in pity. I am left alone in the alley, which even now becomes here, alone in my bed. I awake to sirens.

## Alice

ALICE

"Alice. Alice, wake up," he touched her shoulder, glancing across the car. It was raining, he needed both hands on the wheel. She woke up to the rippling blur of distant fields; water on the side window. Her breath spread and receded upon the glass. She had fallen asleep while they were still in the city and now, later, she saw dreamy green fields in the distance. Cold, gray spring rain. She sat up and ached in a dozen places. Her neck hurt and she winced, "Bleh."

"You should've let your seat back and just slept that way. Laying back." He had to watch the road, so Alice had the distinct perspective of observing him talk without being spoken to directly. His face was tense with worry and concentration. It was raining rather hard, and this stretch of road wasn't very well marked. He couldn't see her watching him, and so he continued, "I knew you were going to wake up sore, slumped over like that." She saw there was grey above his ear. He wrung his fingers on the wheel and kept checking the rearview mirror.

"I'm fine. Where are we?"

"I don't know. I need you to check the map. I think - I think we missed the exit a couple miles back, and I don't see any off-ramp; there's nowhere to turn around." He glanced at her and frowned at her groggy state. She wasn't with him in this moment, she was still waking up or something. He was the one driving and the one who knew how lost they could very well be.

"Are you okay?" He asked, and she heard in it the testy accusation. The implication that she wasn't okay, that somehow she was failing him. She was supposed to be the navigator and now they were lost. She heard his frustrated annoyance spilling onto her. He was embarassed and taking out on her.

"I'm fine. Let me find it."

"What? The map? It's right there, between your feet. You're stepping on it."

"I see it. I've got it." She rustled it open, a sprawling tangle on paper. It seemed entirely ridiculous and unwieldly. She turned it a couple times to get her bearings. She heard him sighing and the creak of his seatbelt. He was irritated, and now she was too.

"Okay, so where are we?" She asked, peering up the main lines, using her finger to trace over their route.

"I don't know. That's the thing, we missed the exit and I'm not sure how to get us back." The edge in his voice made her jaw tighten. She wanted out of the car, to walk and stretch and breathe the cool damp air.

"Well what do you want me to do? I was asleep. You missed the turn." The fight was inevitable and monstrous, clawed and already in the air, mid-pounce.

He rolled his shoulders and she could feel him winding up something sharp to say, something that would hurt. Guilt and doubt began to seep in around the edges; she was the navigator, after all. She did fall asleep, after all. And if she was tired, it kind of was her fault. They had sex last night. In a motel. It was awkward and protracted and he seemed such a little boy then, eager to please and getting nowhere. Perhaps she should've just faked something so they could've gotten to sleep. She couldn't remember the last time she really enjoyed their lovemaking. It had become a confessional and a series of reflexes; habit. And she could feel this now carving the air between them with claws out and fangs showing. She looked at him bristling within himself and wondered if he could sense it too, the inevitable stupidity. She wondered when she stopped loving him, and when she would admit it to him without meaning to, letting it slip by accident.

He glanced over to her again, about to speak. This is what they were going to fight about this time: being lost in the rain. And in the space between the flip and flap of the windshield wipers she saw two things with clarity: she saw his mouth forming the words, and through the crystal pane of the glass already blotting over with fresh drops, she saw the massive rolling wave of metal leaping across the divider. The 16-wheeler sailed through the air with an achingly beautiful grace, and the driver inside stared in stupid, unfocused shock. Completely out of control. There was no time for anything more; the surging tide of it blocked out the gray sky, sweeping everything away.
